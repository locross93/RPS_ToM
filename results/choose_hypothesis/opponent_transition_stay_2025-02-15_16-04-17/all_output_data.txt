            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 1, {'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}].

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the single round of interaction we have:

1. **Round 0**:
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I won

Given this single interaction, we need to predict the opponent's next move based on the possible strategies provided.

- **Strategy 1**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - If the opponent played Scissors, they would play Rock next.

- **Strategy 2**: The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - If the opponent played Scissors, they would play Paper next.

- **Strategy 3**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - If I played Rock, they would play Paper next.

- **Strategy 4**: The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - If I played Rock, they would play Rock next.

- **Strategy 5**: After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - Since the opponent lost, they would play Rock next (to beat their last move, Scissors).

- **Strategy 6**: After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - Since the opponent lost, they would play Paper next (to lose to their last move, Scissors).

- **Strategy 7**: Complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
  - Since the opponent lost and played Scissors (which would lose to my Rock), they would play Rock next (to beat their last move, Scissors).

Based on the single round of interaction, strategies 1, 5, and 7 predict the opponent would play Rock next. However, without further rounds, it's difficult to conclusively determine the opponent's strategy. Given the limited data, I'll choose the simplest strategy that fits: Strategy 1.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move, and they played scissors last round, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {1: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I win

Now, let's evaluate the strategies:

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move:**
  - Round 0: Scissors (would beat Paper)
  - Round 1: Rock (would beat Scissors)
  - This strategy does not match the opponent's plays.

- **The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move:**
  - Round 0: Scissors (would lose to Rock)
  - Round 1: Rock (would lose to Paper)
  - This strategy matches the opponent's plays.

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move:**
  - Round 0: Scissors (would beat Paper)
  - Round 1: Rock (would beat Scissors)
  - This strategy does not match the opponent's plays.

- **The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last rounds move:**
  - Round 0: Scissors (same as Rock)
  - Round 1: Rock (same as Paper)
  - This strategy does not match the opponent's plays.

- **After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move:**
  - Round 0: Scissors (loss, should play Rock)
  - Round 1: Rock (loss, should play Paper)
  - This strategy does not match the opponent's plays.

- **After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round:**
  - Round 0: Scissors (loss, should play Rock)
  - Round 1: Rock (loss, should play Paper)
  - This strategy does not match the opponent's plays.

- **Complex strategy based on previous outcomes and transitions:**
  - This strategy is too complex to match with only two rounds of data.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior so far is: "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy is to play the move that would lose to their last round's move, and their last move was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'scissors', as scissors would lose to rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Top hypotheses: {1: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Outcome: I win

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lose

Now, let's evaluate the opponent's moves against each strategy:

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - Round 0 to 1: Scissors (opponent) to Rock (opponent) - Rock beats Scissors, matches this strategy.
  - Round 1 to 2: Rock (opponent) to Paper (opponent) - Paper beats Rock, matches this strategy.

- **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - Round 0 to 1: Scissors (opponent) to Rock (opponent) - Rock does not lose to Scissors, does not match.
  - Round 1 to 2: Rock (opponent) to Paper (opponent) - Paper does not lose to Rock, does not match.

- **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - Round 0 to 1: Rock (my play) to Rock (opponent) - Rock does not beat Rock, does not match.
  - Round 1 to 2: Paper (my play) to Paper (opponent) - Paper beats Rock, matches this strategy.

- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - Round 0 to 1: Rock (my play) to Rock (opponent) - Matches.
  - Round 1 to 2: Paper (my play) to Paper (opponent) - Matches.

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - Round 0 to 1: Win, Scissors to Rock - Matches.
  - Round 1 to 2: Win, Rock to Paper - Matches.

- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - Round 0 to 1: Win, Scissors to Rock - Matches.
  - Round 1 to 2: Win, Rock to Paper - Matches.

- **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on previous outcomes and transitions.
  - This strategy is too complex to match with only three rounds of data.

Based on the analysis, Strategy 1 and Strategy 6 both match the opponent's behavior in rounds 1 and 2. However, Strategy 1 is simpler and directly matches the observed pattern of the opponent playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, they played 'paper' in the last round. To beat 'paper', they would play 'scissors' in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Top hypotheses: {2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 1: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.05700000000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I win

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lose

4. **Round 3:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: Tie

Now, let's analyze the opponent's behavior:

- **From Round 0 to Round 1:**
  - The opponent played Scissors in Round 0 and then played Rock in Round 1.
  - This transition could be explained by the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move" (Scissors -> Rock).

- **From Round 1 to Round 2:**
  - The opponent played Rock in Round 1 and then played Paper in Round 2.
  - This transition could be explained by the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move" (Rock -> Paper).

- **From Round 2 to Round 3:**
  - The opponent played Paper in Round 2 and then played Rock in Round 3.
  - This transition could be explained by the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" (Paper -> Rock).

Considering the above transitions, the opponent's behavior seems to align most consistently with the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move" for the first two transitions, and "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" for the last transition. However, the most consistent strategy that explains the majority of the transitions is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior so far is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'rock', the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I win

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lose

4. **Round 3:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: Tie

5. **Round 4:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lose

Now, let's evaluate the potential strategies:

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - Round 0 to 1: Scissors -> Rock (Rock beats Scissors)
  - Round 1 to 2: Rock -> Paper (Paper beats Rock)
  - Round 2 to 3: Paper -> Rock (Rock beats Scissors)
  - Round 3 to 4: Rock -> Rock (Rock beats Scissors)
  - This strategy fits well with the opponent's moves.

- **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent's moves are mostly winning against their previous moves.

- **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that beats my last move.

- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently mimic my last move.

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move; after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move; after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently follow this pattern.

- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move; after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move; after a tie, they play the same move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently follow this pattern.

- **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on previous outcomes and transitions.
  - This strategy is too complex for the observed behavior.

The best-fitting strategy is Strategy 1, where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'paper' to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

   - Outcome: Tie

Now, let's analyze the opponent's behavior:

- **Round 1:** After losing with Scissors, the opponent played Rock, which would beat their previous move (Scissors).
- **Round 2:** After losing with Rock, the opponent played Paper, which would beat their previous move (Rock).
- **Round 3:** After winning with Paper, the opponent played Rock, which would lose to their previous move (Paper).
- **Round 4:** After tying with Rock, the opponent played Rock again, which is the same move.
- **Round 5:** After losing with Rock, the opponent played Scissors, which would beat their previous move (Rock).

From this analysis, it seems the opponent's strategy is:

- After a win, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
- After a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round.

This strategy matches the description: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Let's output this strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: 
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next opponent's move (Round 1): Rock

2. **Round 1**:
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next opponent's move (Round 2): Paper

3. **Round 2**:
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next opponent's move (Round 3): Rock

4. **Round 3**:
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Next opponent's move (Round 4): Rock

5. **Round 4**:
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next opponent's move (Round 5): Scissors

6. **Round 5**:
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Next opponent's move (Round 6): Scissors

7. **Round 6**:
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win

**Analysis**:
- After a win (Round 0 and Round 1), the opponent played the move that would beat their last round's move (Scissors -> Rock, Rock -> Paper).
- After a loss (Round 2 and Round 4), the opponent played the move that would lose to their last round's move (Paper -> Rock, Rock -> Scissors).
- After a tie (Round 3 and Round 5), the opponent played the same move as they did in the last round (Rock -> Rock, Scissors -> Scissors).

This pattern matches the strategy:
"After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Therefore, the opponent's strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round, as it would lose to 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next move by opponent (Round 1): Rock

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next move by opponent (Round 2): Paper

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next move by opponent (Round 3): Rock

4. **Round 3:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Next move by opponent (Round 4): Rock

5. **Round 4:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next move by opponent (Round 5): Scissors

6. **Round 5:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Next move by opponent (Round 6): Scissors

7. **Round 6:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next move by opponent (Round 7): Rock

8. **Round 7:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I win

**Analysis:**

- The opponent's move in Round 1 (Rock) is the same as their move in Round 0 (Scissors) would lose to.
- The opponent's move in Round 2 (Paper) is the move that would beat their move in Round 1 (Rock).
- The opponent's move in Round 3 (Rock) is the same as their move in Round 2 (Paper) would lose to.
- The opponent's move in Round 4 (Rock) is the same as their move in Round 3 (Rock).
- The opponent's move in Round 5 (Scissors) is the move that would beat their move in Round 4 (Rock).
- The opponent's move in Round 6 (Scissors) is the same as their move in Round 5 (Scissors).
- The opponent's move in Round 7 (Rock) is the move that would beat their move in Round 6 (Scissors).

Based on the analysis, the opponent seems to follow a pattern where:
- After a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
- After a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round.

This pattern aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played rock and lost, so they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 5: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.26009999999999994, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 1: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.19764999000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves and outcomes:

1. **Round 0 to 1:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'.
   - Next, they played 'rock' which beats 'scissors'.
   - This suggests they might play the move that beats their last move after a loss.

2. **Round 1 to 2:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'.
   - Next, they played 'paper' which beats 'rock'.
   - Again, they played the move that beats their last move after a loss.

3. **Round 2 to 3:**
   - Opponent played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'.
   - Next, they played 'rock', which does not follow a clear pattern of repeating or beating their last move.

4. **Round 3 to 4:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' and tied with my 'rock'.
   - Next, they played 'rock' again, which could indicate repeating the move after a tie.

5. **Round 4 to 5:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'.
   - Next, they played 'scissors', which does not follow a clear pattern of repeating or beating their last move.

6. **Round 5 to 6:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' and tied with my 'scissors'.
   - Next, they played 'scissors' again, repeating the move after a tie.

7. **Round 6 to 7:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'.
   - Next, they played 'rock', which beats 'scissors'.

8. **Round 7 to 8:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'.
   - Next, they played 'paper', which beats 'rock'.

From the above analysis, the opponent seems to follow a pattern where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move. After a tie, they seem to repeat the same move. However, their behavior after a win is not consistent with a single pattern.

The strategy that best fits this behavior is:
- After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

This aligns with the strategy described as:
"After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Thus, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and won. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors next to beat their previous move of paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move and win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.15990000000000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves round by round:

1. **Round 0**: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'rock'. I won.
2. **Round 1**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'paper'. I won.
3. **Round 2**: Opponent played 'paper', I played 'rock'. I lost.
4. **Round 3**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'rock'. Tie.
5. **Round 4**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'scissors'. I lost.
6. **Round 5**: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'scissors'. Tie.
7. **Round 6**: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'rock'. I won.
8. **Round 7**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'paper'. I won.
9. **Round 8**: Opponent played 'paper', I played 'rock'. I lost.
10. **Round 9**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'rock'. Tie.

Now, let's evaluate the strategies:

1. **The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move**: This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that beats their last move.
   
2. **The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move**: This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that loses to their last move.

3. **The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move**: This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that beats my last move.

4. **The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move**: This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently play the same move as my last move.

5. **After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move**: This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently follow this pattern.

6. **After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round**: This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently follow this pattern.

7. **The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition**: This strategy is complex and accounts for different scenarios based on the outcome and the transition. Let's see if it fits:

   - After a win in which the opponent played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they play the move that would beat their last move. This fits rounds 0 to 1 and 6 to 7.
   - After a loss in which the opponent played the move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they play the move that would beat their last move. This fits rounds 2 to 3.
   - After a tie in which the opponent played the same move as I did two rounds ago, they play the move that would beat their last move. This fits rounds 5 to 6.

Given the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to align most closely with the seventh strategy, which accounts for transitions based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and it resulted in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter-move is to play 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.41193, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0 to Round 1:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'.
   - Next, opponent played 'rock', which would beat their previous 'scissors'.
   - This could align with the strategy: "After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move."

2. **Round 1 to Round 2:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'.
   - Next, opponent played 'paper', which would beat their previous 'rock'.
   - This again aligns with the strategy: "After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move."

3. **Round 2 to Round 3:**
   - Opponent played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'.
   - Next, opponent played 'rock', which would lose to their previous 'paper'.
   - This aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

4. **Round 3 to Round 4:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' and tied with my 'rock'.
   - Next, opponent played 'rock' again.
   - This aligns with the strategy: "After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

5. **Round 4 to Round 5:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'.
   - Next, opponent played 'scissors', which would lose to their previous 'rock'.
   - This aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

6. **Round 5 to Round 6:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' and tied with my 'scissors'.
   - Next, opponent played 'scissors' again.
   - This aligns with the strategy: "After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

7. **Round 6 to Round 7:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'.
   - Next, opponent played 'rock', which would beat their previous 'scissors'.
   - This aligns with the strategy: "After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move."

8. **Round 7 to Round 8:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'.
   - Next, opponent played 'paper', which would beat their previous 'rock'.
   - This aligns with the strategy: "After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move."

9. **Round 8 to Round 9:**
   - Opponent played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'.
   - Next, opponent played 'rock', which would lose to their previous 'paper'.
   - This aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

10. **Round 9 to Round 10:**
    - Opponent played 'rock' and tied with my 'rock'.
    - Next, opponent played 'rock' again.
    - This aligns with the strategy: "After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

11. **Round 10 to Round 11:**
    - Opponent played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'.
    - Next, opponent played 'rock', which would lose to their previous 'rock'.
    - This aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns most consistently with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it would lose to their last move 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.5883510000000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 11: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Round 0 to 1:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' in round 0 and 'rock' in round 1.
   - This transition could fit the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors -> rock).

2. **Round 1 to 2:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' in round 1 and 'paper' in round 2.
   - This transition fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (rock -> paper).

3. **Round 2 to 3:**
   - Opponent played 'paper' in round 2 and 'rock' in round 3.
   - This transition fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (paper -> rock).

4. **Round 3 to 4:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' in round 3 and 'rock' in round 4.
   - This transition fits the strategy where the opponent plays the same move as their last round's move (rock -> rock).

5. **Round 4 to 5:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' in round 4 and 'scissors' in round 5.
   - This transition fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (rock -> scissors).

6. **Round 5 to 6:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' in round 5 and 'scissors' in round 6.
   - This transition fits the strategy where the opponent plays the same move as their last round's move (scissors -> scissors).

7. **Round 6 to 7:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' in round 6 and 'rock' in round 7.
   - This transition fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors -> rock).

8. **Round 7 to 8:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' in round 7 and 'paper' in round 8.
   - This transition fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (rock -> paper).

9. **Round 8 to 9:**
   - Opponent played 'paper' in round 8 and 'rock' in round 9.
   - This transition fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (paper -> rock).

10. **Round 9 to 10:**
    - Opponent played 'rock' in round 9 and 'rock' in round 10.
    - This transition fits the strategy where the opponent plays the same move as their last round's move (rock -> rock).

11. **Round 10 to 11:**
    - Opponent played 'rock' in round 10 and 'scissors' in round 11.
    - This transition fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (rock -> scissors).

The pattern that emerges is that the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last round's move or the move that would lose to their last round's move. This suggests that the opponent is likely using the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

Let's confirm this choice by checking if it consistently predicts the opponent's moves:

- When the opponent played 'scissors', they played 'rock' next.
- When the opponent played 'rock', they played 'paper' next.
- When the opponent played 'paper', they played 'rock' next.

This pattern aligns with the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

Therefore, the best-fitting strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move, and their last move was 'scissors', I predict their next play will be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.7982919900000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost, so they are likely to play 'scissors' next to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves round by round:

1. **Round 0 to 1**: Opponent played 'scissors' then 'rock'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors -> rock).

2. **Round 1 to 2**: Opponent played 'rock' then 'paper'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (rock -> paper).

3. **Round 2 to 3**: Opponent played 'paper' then 'rock'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (paper -> rock).

4. **Round 3 to 4**: Opponent played 'rock' then 'rock'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the same move as their last round's move (rock -> rock).

5. **Round 4 to 5**: Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (rock -> scissors).

6. **Round 5 to 6**: Opponent played 'scissors' then 'scissors'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the same move as their last round's move (scissors -> scissors).

7. **Round 6 to 7**: Opponent played 'scissors' then 'rock'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors -> rock).

8. **Round 7 to 8**: Opponent played 'rock' then 'paper'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (rock -> paper).

9. **Round 8 to 9**: Opponent played 'paper' then 'rock'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (paper -> rock).

10. **Round 9 to 10**: Opponent played 'rock' then 'rock'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the same move as their last round's move (rock -> rock).

11. **Round 10 to 11**: Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (rock -> scissors).

12. **Round 11 to 12**: Opponent played 'scissors' then 'rock'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors -> rock).

13. **Round 12 to 13**: Opponent played 'rock' then 'paper'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (rock -> paper).

14. **Round 13 to 14**: Opponent played 'paper' then 'rock'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (paper -> rock).

15. **Round 14 to 15**: Opponent played 'rock' then 'rock'. This transition could be explained by the strategy where the opponent plays the same move as their last round's move (rock -> rock).

From the analysis, the opponent seems to be following a pattern where they often play the move that would beat their last round's move. This is consistent with the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'rock', their likely next play will be 'paper' to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Round 0 to 1**: 
   - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'rock'. 
   - This could fit the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move ('scissors' -> 'rock').

2. **Round 1 to 2**: 
   - Opponent played 'rock' then 'paper'.
   - This fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move ('rock' -> 'paper').

3. **Round 2 to 3**: 
   - Opponent played 'paper' then 'rock'.
   - This fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move ('paper' -> 'rock').

4. **Round 3 to 4**: 
   - Opponent played 'rock' then 'rock'.
   - This does not fit the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. It fits the strategy where the opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.

5. **Round 4 to 5**: 
   - Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'.
   - This fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move ('rock' -> 'scissors').

6. **Round 5 to 6**: 
   - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'scissors'.
   - This fits the strategy where the opponent plays the same move as their last round's move.

7. **Round 6 to 7**: 
   - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'rock'.
   - This fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move ('scissors' -> 'rock').

8. **Round 7 to 8**: 
   - Opponent played 'rock' then 'paper'.
   - This fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move ('rock' -> 'paper').

9. **Round 8 to 9**: 
   - Opponent played 'paper' then 'rock'.
   - This fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move ('paper' -> 'rock').

10. **Round 9 to 10**: 
    - Opponent played 'rock' then 'rock'.
    - This fits the strategy where the opponent plays the same move as their last round's move.

11. **Round 10 to 11**: 
    - Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'.
    - This fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move ('rock' -> 'scissors').

12. **Round 11 to 12**: 
    - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'rock'.
    - This fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move ('scissors' -> 'rock').

13. **Round 12 to 13**: 
    - Opponent played 'rock' then 'paper'.
    - This fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move ('rock' -> 'paper').

14. **Round 13 to 14**: 
    - Opponent played 'paper' then 'rock'.
    - This fits the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move ('paper' -> 'rock').

15. **Round 14 to 15**: 
    - Opponent played 'rock' then 'rock'.
    - This fits the strategy where the opponent plays the same move as their last round's move.

The pattern that fits most consistently is the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. However, there are instances where the opponent repeats their last move or plays the move that would lose to their last round's move, suggesting a more complex strategy.

Given the complexity and variability, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the one where the opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This strategy accounts for the variability in the opponent's moves after wins, losses, and ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win where the opponent played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'rock' last round, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves based on the history provided:

1. **Round 0 to 1**: 
   - Opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'.
   - Next, they played 'rock' against my 'paper'.
   - This could align with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors -> rock).

2. **Round 1 to 2**:
   - Opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'.
   - Next, they played 'paper' against my 'rock'.
   - This again aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move (rock -> paper).

3. **Round 2 to 3**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'.
   - Next, they played 'rock' against my 'rock'.
   - This could align with the strategy where after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move (paper -> rock).

4. **Round 3 to 4**:
   - Opponent played 'rock' and tied with my 'rock'.
   - Next, they played 'rock' against my 'scissors'.
   - This aligns with the strategy where after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move (rock -> rock).

5. **Round 4 to 5**:
   - Opponent played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'.
   - Next, they played 'scissors' against my 'scissors'.
   - This could align with the strategy where after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move (rock -> scissors).

6. **Round 5 to 6**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' and tied with my 'scissors'.
   - Next, they played 'scissors' against my 'rock'.
   - This aligns with the strategy where after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move (scissors -> scissors).

7. **Round 6 to 7**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'.
   - Next, they played 'rock' against my 'paper'.
   - This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors -> rock).

8. **Round 7 to 8**:
   - Opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'.
   - Next, they played 'paper' against my 'rock'.
   - This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move (rock -> paper).

9. **Round 8 to 9**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'.
   - Next, they played 'rock' against my 'rock'.
   - This could align with the strategy where after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move (paper -> rock).

10. **Round 9 to 10**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' and tied with my 'rock'.
    - Next, they played 'rock' against my 'scissors'.
    - This aligns with the strategy where after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move (rock -> rock).

11. **Round 10 to 11**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'.
    - Next, they played 'scissors' against my 'rock'.
    - This could align with the strategy where after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move (rock -> scissors).

12. **Round 11 to 12**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'.
    - Next, they played 'rock' against my 'paper'.
    - This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors -> rock).

13. **Round 12 to 13**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'.
    - Next, they played 'paper' against my 'scissors'.
    - This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move (rock -> paper).

14. **Round 13 to 14**:
    - Opponent played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'.
    - Next, they played 'rock' against my 'rock'.
    - This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move (paper -> rock).

15. **Round 14 to 15**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' and tied with my 'rock'.
    - Next, they played 'rock' against my 'scissors'.
    - This aligns with the strategy where after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move (rock -> rock).

16. **Round 15 to 16**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'.
    - Next, they played 'scissors' against my 'scissors'.
    - This could align with the strategy where after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move (rock -> scissors).

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to align most consistently with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

Thus, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since their last move was scissors, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.7735857, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round ended in a tie with both of us playing scissors, I predict that the opponent will play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.961946548599, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {11: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.3733625840193, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'rock' (I won).
2. **Round 1**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'paper' (I won).
3. **Round 2**: Opponent played 'paper', I played 'rock' (I lost).
4. **Round 3**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'rock' (tie).
5. **Round 4**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'scissors' (I lost).
6. **Round 5**: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'scissors' (tie).
7. **Round 6**: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'rock' (I won).
8. **Round 7**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'paper' (I won).
9. **Round 8**: Opponent played 'paper', I played 'rock' (I lost).
10. **Round 9**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'rock' (tie).
11. **Round 10**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'scissors' (I lost).
12. **Round 11**: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'rock' (I won).
13. **Round 12**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'paper' (I won).
14. **Round 13**: Opponent played 'paper', I played 'scissors' (I won).
15. **Round 14**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'rock' (tie).
16. **Round 15**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'scissors' (I lost).
17. **Round 16**: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'scissors' (tie).
18. **Round 17**: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'scissors' (tie).
19. **Round 18**: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'rock' (I won).
20. **Round 19**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'paper' (I won).
21. **Round 20**: Opponent played 'paper', I played 'scissors' (I won).
22. **Round 21**: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'rock' (I won).
23. **Round 22**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'paper' (I won).
24. **Round 23**: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'scissors' (I lost).

**Analysis:**

- The opponent seems to play 'rock' after I win with 'paper' (Rounds 1, 7, 12, 19).
- The opponent plays 'paper' after I win with 'rock' (Rounds 2, 8, 13, 20).
- The opponent plays 'scissors' after I win with 'scissors' (Rounds 6, 11, 18, 21).
- The opponent tends to repeat their move after a tie (Rounds 3-4, 5-6, 9-10, 14-15, 16-17).

The opponent's behavior suggests they are likely following a strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss, and repeat the same move after a tie. This aligns with the strategy:

"After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy best explains the opponent's behavior so far.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they won with 'rock' against my 'scissors'. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' next, as it would beat their last move 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves are: Scissors, Rock, Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors.
   - There seems to be a pattern where the opponent frequently plays Rock after losing or tying.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win: The opponent tends to repeat the move or switch to Rock.
   - After a loss: The opponent often switches to Rock.
   - After a tie: The opponent sometimes repeats the move or switches to Rock.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit well as the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that beats their last move.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit well either, as the opponent doesn't consistently play the losing move.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit well, as the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that beats my last move.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit well, as the opponent doesn't consistently mirror my last move.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This partially fits, but the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that would beat their last move after a loss.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
     - This doesn't fit well, as the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that would beat their last move after a win.
   - **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
     - This strategy is complex and could potentially fit the observed behavior, as it allows for varied responses based on the outcome and previous transitions.

Given the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to be best explained by Strategy 7, which accounts for the varied responses based on both the outcome and previous transitions.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the outcome was a tie with both players playing scissors. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, the opponent will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent's moves: scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors.
   - My moves: rock, paper, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, paper.

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to play rock frequently after losing or tying, which suggests a preference for rock.
   - After winning with scissors (round 25), the opponent played scissors again in round 26, indicating a possible pattern of repeating a winning move.
   - The opponent's move in round 25 (scissors) beat my move in round 24 (scissors), suggesting they might be playing the move that beats my last move.

3. **Strategy Evaluation**:
   - **Strategy 1**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. This doesn't fit well, as the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that beats their previous move.
   - **Strategy 2**: The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. This doesn't fit, as the opponent doesn't consistently play the losing move.
   - **Strategy 3**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move. This fits well, as the opponent often plays the move that beats my last move.
   - **Strategy 4**: The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move. This doesn't fit, as the opponent doesn't consistently mirror my last move.
   - **Strategy 5**: After a win, the opponent plays the same move; after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move; after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last move. This partially fits but not consistently.
   - **Strategy 6**: After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last move; after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last move; after a tie, they play the same move. This doesn't fit well.
   - **Strategy 7**: Complex transition strategy based on previous outcomes and transitions. This is too complex for the observed behavior.

4. **Conclusion**:
   The opponent's behavior is best explained by Strategy 3, where they play the move that would beat my last round's move. This strategy accurately predicts the opponent's moves in several rounds, particularly when they win.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move, and my last play was paper, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely next play is scissors, my next play should be rock to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

    - Next, opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper'.
    - This suggests the opponent might be playing the move that would beat their last round's move ('scissors' -> 'rock').

From the analysis, it seems that the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last round's move, especially after a loss. After a win, they sometimes repeat the same move or play the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, they often repeat the same move. This behavior aligns with the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss, and repeats the same move after a tie.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move, and their last move was 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'scissors' to beat 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

27. **Round 26 to 27**: 
    - Opponent played 'rock' then 'rock'. 
    - They played the same move as their last round's move.

From the analysis, the opponent seems to follow a pattern where they often play the move that would beat their last round's move, but sometimes they play the same move or the move that would lose to their last round's move. This behavior is consistent with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions step by step:

1. **Round 0:** Opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. 
   - Next move: 'rock'. This could be explained by playing the move that would beat their last move ('scissors').

2. **Round 1:** Opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'.
   - Next move: 'paper'. This could be explained by playing the move that would beat their last move ('rock').

3. **Round 2:** Opponent played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'.
   - Next move: 'rock'. This could be explained by playing the move that would beat their last move ('paper').

4. **Round 3:** Opponent played 'rock' and tied with my 'rock'.
   - Next move: 'rock'. This could be explained by playing the same move as their last move.

5. **Round 4:** Opponent played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'.
   - Next move: 'scissors'. This could be explained by playing the move that would lose to their last move ('rock').

6. **Round 5:** Opponent played 'scissors' and tied with my 'scissors'.
   - Next move: 'scissors'. This could be explained by playing the same move as their last move.

7. **Round 6:** Opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'.
   - Next move: 'rock'. This could be explained by playing the move that would beat their last move ('scissors').

    - Next move: 'paper'. This could be explained by playing the move that would beat their last move ('rock').

From the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to follow a pattern where they often play the move that would beat their last move. This aligns with the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

Therefore, the most consistent strategy that explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move, and their last move was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'paper' to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next to beat their previous 'paper'.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

    - Opponent's response: 'rock' (lost to my 'paper') to 'rock' (beat my 'scissors').

From the analysis, it seems that the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss, and sometimes they repeat the same move after a tie. This behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Let's select this strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best explains their behavior.

1. **Round 0 to 1**: 
   - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'rock'. This could fit the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors -> rock).

2. **Round 1 to 2**: 
   - Opponent played 'rock' then 'paper'. This fits the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move (rock -> paper).

3. **Round 2 to 3**: 
   - Opponent played 'paper' then 'rock'. This fits the strategy where they play the move that would lose to their last round's move (paper -> rock).

15. **Round 14 to 15**: 
    - Opponent played 'rock' then 'rock'. This fits the strategy where they play the same move as their last round's move.

16. **Round 15 to 16**: 
    - Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'. This fits the strategy where they play the move that would lose to their last round's move (rock -> scissors).

17. **Round 16 to 17**: 
    - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'scissors'. This fits the strategy where they play the same move as their last round's move.

18. **Round 17 to 18**: 
    - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'scissors'. This fits the strategy where they play the same move as their last round's move.

19. **Round 18 to 19**: 
    - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'rock'. This fits the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors -> rock).

20. **Round 19 to 20**: 
    - Opponent played 'rock' then 'paper'. This fits the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move (rock -> paper).

21. **Round 20 to 21**:

22. **Round 21 to 22**: 
    - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'rock'. This fits the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors -> rock).

23. **Round 22 to 23**: 
    - Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'. This fits the strategy where they play the move that would lose to their last round's move (rock -> scissors).

24. **Round 23 to 24**: 
    - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'scissors'. This fits the strategy where they play the same move as their last round's move.

25. **Round 24 to 25**: 
    - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'scissors'. This fits the strategy where they play the same move as their last round's move.

26. **Round 25 to 26**: 
    - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'rock'. This fits the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors -> rock).

27. **Round 26 to 27**: 
    - Opponent played 'rock' then 'rock'. This fits the strategy where they play the same move as their last round's move.

28. **Round 27 to 28**: 
    - Opponent played 'rock' then 'rock'. This fits the strategy where they play the same move as their last round's move.

29. **Round 28 to 29**: 
    - Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'. This fits the strategy where they play the move that would lose to their last round's move (rock -> scissors).

30. **Round 29 to 30**: 
    - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'scissors'. This fits the strategy where they play the same move as their last round's move.

31. **Round 30 to 31**: 
    - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'scissors'. This fits the strategy where they play the same move as their last round's move.

32. **Round 31 to 32**: 
    - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'rock'. This fits the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors -> rock).

33. **Round 32 to 33**: 
    - Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'. This fits the strategy where they play the move that would lose to their last round's move (rock -> scissors).

From the analysis, it seems the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last round's move, but there are instances where they play the same move or the move that would lose to their last round's move. This suggests a mixed strategy, but the most consistent pattern is playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

Therefore, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, their last play was 'scissors'. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Based on the analysis, the opponent's moves often fit the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move. This strategy is consistent with the majority of the rounds.

Therefore, the most likely strategy the opponent is using is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and their last move was 'scissors', I predict their next play will be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

Top hypotheses: {33: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.363, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 35: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For example:
     - Round 0: Opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. Next round, they played 'rock'.
     - Round 1: Opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. Next round, they played 'paper'.
     - Round 2: Opponent played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'. Next round, they played 'rock'.
     - Round 3: Opponent played 'rock' and tied with my 'rock'. Next round, they played 'rock'.
     - Round 4: Opponent played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'. Next round, they played 'rock'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, they often switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, they sometimes repeat the same move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern where their next move depends on the outcome of the previous round.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit their behavior well.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played rock and I played paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter-move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves based on the given history:

36. **Round 35 to 36**: Opponent played 'scissors' then 'rock'. This could fit the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move ('scissors' -> 'rock').

After analyzing the rounds, the opponent's behavior seems to fit the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move. This pattern is consistent across multiple rounds.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'scissors' to beat their previous 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves are: `scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, scissors`.
   - The opponent seems to frequently repeat moves or switch to a move that beats or loses to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that beats their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that beats their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that loses to their last move.

3. **Strategy Comparison:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This does not consistently match the opponent's behavior.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This also does not consistently match the opponent's behavior.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This does not consistently match the opponent's behavior.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This does not consistently match the opponent's behavior.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This strategy partially matches the opponent's behavior but not consistently.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
     - This strategy partially matches the opponent's behavior but not consistently.
   - **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.
     - This strategy is complex and considers multiple factors, which seems to align with the observed behavior.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's moves, Strategy 7 seems to best explain the opponent's behavior so far. It accounts for different transitions based on the outcome and previous transitions, which matches the observed patterns.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'rock' and the opponent played 'scissors', resulting in my win. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'scissors' last round, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper' to secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'scissors' to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, which suggests that they play the move that would beat their last round's move, the opponent played 'rock' in the last round. To beat 'rock', they would play 'paper'. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after they win, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and won. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be 'rock'.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent's moves are: scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, scissors, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, rock, scissors.
   - The opponent's responses to my moves are varied, with no immediate repetitive pattern.

2. **Patterns Based on Outcomes:**
   - **After Wins:** The opponent seems to repeat their move or choose a move that would beat their last move.
   - **After Losses:** The opponent often chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - **After Ties:** The opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior:
     - After wins, the opponent often repeats their move.
     - After losses, the opponent chooses a move that would beat their last move.
     - After ties, the opponent sometimes chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The observed behavior aligns most closely with the strategy where the opponent repeats their move after a win, chooses a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and chooses a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

     - After winning against my 'rock' with 'paper' in round 2, they played 'rock' in round 3, which would lose to their previous move 'paper'.
     - After losing to my 'rock' with 'scissors' in round 6, they played 'rock' in round 7, which would beat their previous move 'scissors'.
     - After tying with my 'rock' with 'rock' in round 3, they played 'scissors' in round 4, which would lose to their previous move 'rock'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a tie, the opponent seems to play the move that would lose to their last round's move.

3. **Matching Strategy:**
   - The strategy that matches this behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains the opponent's behavior in the interaction history. Therefore, the best-fitting strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', I should play 'paper' in the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

The opponent's behavior seems to be consistent with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the opponent's behavior quite well, as they often switch to a move that beats their last move after a win, switch to a move that loses to their last move after a loss, and play the same move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.14962276563658156, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary and do not consistently follow a single pattern of always beating or losing to their previous move.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats the same move, changes to a move that beats or loses to their previous move, or mirrors my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - **Wins**: 
     - After winning (e.g., round 0, 1, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 28, 29, 30, 31, 35, 36, 37, 38), the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that beats their last move.
   - **Losses**:
     - After losing (e.g., round 2, 4, 10, 15, 23, 25, 26, 32, 34, 40, 41, 42), the opponent sometimes switches to a move that beats their last move or repeats their last move.
   - **Ties**:
     - After ties (e.g., round 3, 5, 9, 14, 16, 17, 24, 27, 33, 39, 44), the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that loses to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be influenced by the outcome of the previous round, but not consistently in a straightforward manner.
   - The strategy that best fits the observed behavior is the one where the opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This strategy accounts for the variability in their responses after wins, losses, and ties.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that most accurately predicts the opponent's moves is the complex one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played 'rock', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. Since the opponent played 'rock' in both the last round and two rounds ago, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next, my best counter move would be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.4047359359456071, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves are: Scissors, Rock, Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Rock, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Rock, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Rock.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent often repeats the same move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats the same move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Comparison:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior well.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win and switch to a winning move after a loss.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they won with 'rock'. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

From the analysis, it appears that the opponent is consistently playing the move that would beat their last round's move. This pattern is evident in the majority of the rounds. Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'scissors', I predict their next play will be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.7083206086133474, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round ended in a tie with both of us playing paper, I predict that the opponent will play paper again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of paper, I should play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.7958244260293432, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter their move and win the round.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after winning the last round with 'scissors', the opponent is likely to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played 'scissors' last, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move. For example, when they played 'rock', they often follow up with 'paper' (which beats 'rock').
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their last move after a tie, such as in rounds 5 and 16.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, but this is not consistent.
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move, suggesting they are trying to counteract their previous loss.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, but this is not consistent.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to fit some of the observed patterns, but not all.
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move" fits many of the observed patterns, especially after losses and ties.

Given the analysis, the strategy that most consistently explains the opponent's behavior is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move, and they played scissors in the last round, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play rock, my next play should be paper to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.5309774446896454, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions:

1. **Identify Patterns:**
   - The opponent's moves after each round need to be analyzed to see if they follow a consistent pattern.
   - We need to check if the opponent's move is based on their previous move, my previous move, or the outcome of the previous round.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** When the opponent wins, do they repeat their move, switch to a move that would beat their last move, or switch to a move that would lose to their last move?
   - **Losses:** When the opponent loses, do they switch to a move that would beat their last move, repeat their move, or switch to a move that would lose to their last move?
   - **Ties:** When the opponent ties, do they repeat their move, switch to a move that would beat their last move, or switch to a move that would lose to their last move?

3. **Strategy Evaluation:**
   - **Round 52:** Opponent played 'scissors' after I played 'paper' and they won. This suggests they might repeat their move after a win.
   - **Round 51:** Opponent played 'scissors' after a tie with 'scissors'. This suggests they might repeat their move after a tie.
   - **Round 50:** Opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'scissors'. This suggests they might switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.

4. **Strategy Matching:**
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win and a tie, and switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.
   - This matches the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.6716842112827517, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move, changes to a move that beats their last move, or changes to a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that beats their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that beats their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to match some of the observed behavior.
   - However, the strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." provides a more nuanced explanation that considers both the outcome and the transition made by the opponent.

Given the complexity of the opponent's behavior and the observed transitions, the most fitting strategy is the one that considers both the outcome and the transition made by the opponent. This strategy accounts for the variations in the opponent's responses based on different scenarios.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'rock' and the opponent played 'paper', resulting in my loss. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'paper' last round, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be to play 'rock' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.7701789478979262, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round ended in a tie with both playing 'rock', the opponent is likely to play 'rock' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.9211713791289887, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.9729617830412431, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost, so they are likely to play 'rock' next to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's move in the last round was 'scissors' after I played 'paper'.
   - In the previous round (round 60), the opponent played 'scissors' after I played 'rock'.
   - In round 59, the opponent played 'paper' after I played 'scissors'.
   - This suggests that the opponent might be playing the move that would beat my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning in round 61 (opponent played 'scissors' against my 'paper'), the opponent played 'scissors' again.
   - After losing in round 60 (opponent played 'scissors' against my 'rock'), the opponent played 'scissors' again.
   - After winning in round 59 (opponent played 'paper' against my 'scissors'), the opponent played 'scissors'.
   - This behavior does not seem to change based on the outcome (win, loss, or tie).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent consistently plays the move that would beat my last move. This aligns with the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move."

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move, and I last played paper, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, I should play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - When I played 'rock' in round 62, the opponent played 'paper', which beats 'rock'.
   - In round 61, I played 'paper', and the opponent played 'scissors', which beats 'paper'.
   - In round 60, I played 'rock', and the opponent played 'scissors', which loses to 'rock'.
   - In round 59, I played 'scissors', and the opponent played 'paper', which loses to 'scissors'.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After winning in round 61 (opponent played 'scissors' against my 'paper'), the opponent played 'paper' in round 62, which beats their previous move 'scissors'.
   - After losing in round 60 (opponent played 'scissors' against my 'rock'), the opponent played 'scissors' again in round 61, which loses to my 'paper'.
   - After winning in round 59 (opponent played 'paper' against my 'scissors'), the opponent played 'scissors' in round 60, which beats their previous move 'paper'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a win.
   - After a loss, they seem to play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - After a tie, they seem to play the same move as they did in the last round.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and won. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors next, as it beats their last move, paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays of rock, paper, and scissors don't show a consistent pattern of directly countering my last move. For instance, after I played rock in round 63, they played rock, resulting in a tie.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After ties, the opponent seems to play the move that would lose to their last move. For example, after a tie in round 63 (both played rock), if they follow this pattern, they would play scissors next (since scissors loses to rock).
   - After wins, the opponent sometimes repeats their winning move or plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After losses, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior after ties aligns with the strategy: "After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."
   - The behavior after wins and losses is less consistent but sometimes aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

Considering these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:
- "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Thus, the selected strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, I should play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

Top hypotheses: {63: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays of rock, paper, and scissors do not show a consistent pattern of directly countering my last move. For example, when I played rock in rounds 63 and 64, the opponent also played rock, resulting in ties.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After ties (e.g., rounds 27, 39, 44, 54, 63, 64), the opponent tends to repeat the same move (rock in these cases).
   - After losses (e.g., round 23, 32, 45), the opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat their previous move (e.g., from rock to paper).
   - After wins (e.g., rounds 19, 21, 28, 31, 35), the opponent sometimes repeats the winning move or switches to a move that would beat their previous move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior:
     - After ties, the opponent often repeats the same move (rock).
     - After losses, the opponent switches to a move that would beat their previous move.
     - After wins, the opponent sometimes repeats the winning move or switches to a move that would beat their previous move.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing 'rock', the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {63: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.363, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.3515956868757417, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has played 'rock' for the last three rounds (63, 64, 65), resulting in ties each time. This suggests a potential pattern when ties occur.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie (rounds 63, 64, 65), the opponent repeated the same move ('rock'). This suggests that after a tie, the opponent might be inclined to repeat their last move.
   - Looking further back, after a win (e.g., round 22, opponent played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'), the opponent switched to 'scissors' in round 23, which would lose to their previous move 'rock'. This suggests a potential pattern after wins.
   - After losses, such as in round 25 (opponent played 'scissors' and won against my 'paper'), the opponent switched to 'rock' in round 26, which would beat their previous move 'scissors'. This suggests a pattern after losses.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a tie.
   - After a win, they seem to play the move that would lose to their last move.
   - After a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

These observations align with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Thus, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the given strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has played 'rock' multiple times when I played 'scissors' (rounds 23, 32, 40, 45).
   - The opponent has played 'scissors' multiple times when I played 'paper' (rounds 25, 34, 41, 46, 52, 61).
   - The opponent has played 'paper' multiple times when I played 'rock' (rounds 26, 42, 53, 62).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning (e.g., round 23), the opponent tends to repeat the move that won (e.g., 'rock' in round 24).
   - After losing (e.g., round 22), the opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., 'rock' to 'scissors' in round 23).
   - After ties (e.g., round 27), the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., 'rock' in round 28).

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the observed behavior:
- After winning, the opponent often changes to a move that would beat their previous move.
- After losing, the opponent changes to a move that would lose to their previous move.
- After ties, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move.

Therefore, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round, as it would lose to 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.6822818865691134, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 66: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 63: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's move after my play of 'rock' in round 67 was 'paper', which beats 'rock'. This suggests they might be playing the move that beats my last move.
   - However, looking at previous rounds, the opponent's moves don't consistently beat my last move. For example, in round 66, they played 'rock' against my 'paper', which doesn't fit this pattern.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 67 where they won with 'paper' against my 'rock'), they played 'paper' again in round 68. This suggests they might repeat their winning move.
   - After a loss, such as in round 66 where they lost with 'rock' against my 'paper', they switched to 'paper' in round 67, which beats 'rock'. This suggests they might switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss.
   - After a tie, such as in rounds 63, 64, and 65, where both played 'rock', they eventually switched to 'paper' in round 66, which beats 'rock'. This suggests they might switch to a move that beats their last move after a tie.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."
   - This strategy explains their behavior in rounds 66 to 68, where they repeated 'paper' after winning, switched to 'paper' after losing with 'rock', and switched to 'paper' after a tie with 'rock'.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move"
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after winning the last round with paper, they are likely to play the same move again, which is paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's plays after my moves are as follows:
     - Round 69: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper' (opponent wins).
     - Round 68: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock' (opponent wins).
     - Round 67: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper' (opponent wins).
     - Round 66: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock' (I win).
     - Round 65: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock' (tie).
     - Round 64: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock' (tie).
     - Round 63: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock' (tie).
     - Round 62: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper' (opponent wins).
     - Round 61: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors' (opponent wins).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat the move that won.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat my last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

   - This strategy explains:
     - Repeating 'paper' after winning against 'rock' in rounds 67 and 69.
     - Switching to 'rock' after losing to 'paper' in round 66.
     - Repeating 'rock' after ties in rounds 63, 64, and 65.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is most likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {66: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.41193, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent seems to frequently play 'rock' when I play 'scissors', resulting in my loss.
   - When I play 'rock', the opponent often plays 'paper', again resulting in my loss.
   - When I play 'paper', the opponent sometimes plays 'scissors', leading to my loss.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After the opponent wins, they often play the move that would beat their last move. For example, after winning with 'rock' against my 'scissors', they play 'paper' next.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's response seems less predictable, but they sometimes repeat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the observed behavior where the opponent often changes their move after a win to beat their previous move, and sometimes repeats or changes their move after a loss or tie.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they won with 'rock' against my 'scissors'. Therefore, their next move is likely to be 'paper', which beats 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

Top hypotheses: {66: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.5883510000000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the given strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has played rock, paper, and scissors in various rounds, but there isn't a consistent pattern of playing the move that would beat or lose to my last move.
   - For example, in round 22, I played paper and they played rock, which I won. In round 23, I played scissors and they played rock again, which they won. This doesn't fit a pattern of playing the move that would beat or lose to my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 22 to 23) and sometimes changes it (e.g., rounds 28 to 29).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes changes their move (e.g., rounds 23 to 24) and sometimes repeats it (e.g., rounds 26 to 27).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 24 to 25) and sometimes changes it (e.g., rounds 33 to 34).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit some of the rounds but not consistently.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" also fits some rounds but not consistently.
   - The complex strategy involving transitions based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to fit the observed behavior more closely, as it accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses.

Given the variability and the observed transitions, the complex strategy seems to best explain the opponent's behavior. Therefore, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent\'s move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent\'s move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent\'s move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent\'s move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent\'s move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent\'s move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move in the last round as they did two rounds ago, the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since the opponent played 'scissors' in the last two rounds, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.7118457, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and won. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next, as it would lose to 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.858804393, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to beat 'rock'.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.951569906799, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it against the possible strategies.

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves after ties, wins, and losses need to be analyzed to see if they follow a consistent pattern.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - **Ties**: In the recent history, after a tie (rounds 33, 39, 44, 47, 51, 54, 63, 64, 65, 71, 79), the opponent's next move doesn't consistently follow a single pattern. For example, after a tie in round 33, the opponent played scissors again in round 34, which would lose to their previous move (scissors). This suggests a possible pattern of playing the move that would lose to their last move after a tie.
   - **Wins**: After winning (rounds 30, 31, 35, 36, 37, 38, 43, 48, 49, 50, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 66, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78), the opponent often repeats their winning move or plays a move that would beat their last move. For instance, after winning in round 30 with scissors, they played rock in round 31, which beats scissors.
   - **Losses**: After losing (rounds 32, 34, 40, 41, 42, 45, 46, 52, 53, 61, 62, 67, 68, 69, 70, 72), the opponent seems to play a move that would beat their last move. For example, after losing in round 32 with rock, they played scissors in round 33, which would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior after ties, wins, and losses suggests a pattern where:
     - After a win, they might play the same move or a move that beats their last move.
     - After a loss, they tend to play a move that beats their last move.
     - After a tie, they often play a move that would lose to their last move.

The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch to a move that beats or loses to their previous move. We need to see if there is a consistent pattern.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that beats their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that beats their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that loses to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be influenced by the outcome of the previous round (win, lose, tie) and sometimes by their previous move.
   - The strategy that considers both the outcome and the previous move seems to fit well. Specifically, the strategy where:
     - After a win, the opponent may repeat their move or play the move that beats their last move.
     - After a loss, the opponent plays the move that beats their last move.
     - After a tie, the opponent plays the move that loses to their last move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing 'rock', the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary without a clear pattern of directly countering my previous move. For example, when I played 'rock' in round 81, they also played 'rock', resulting in a tie. In previous rounds, there are instances where they repeated moves or switched without a clear counter-strategy.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After ties, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., rounds 80 and 81 both resulted in ties with 'rock').
   - After losses, there are instances where they switch to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 34 to 35, they switched from 'scissors' to 'rock' after losing to my 'paper').
   - After wins, they sometimes repeat the winning move or switch to a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they respond to outcomes (win, lose, tie) with specific transitions. Specifically, they often repeat moves after ties and switch to a move that would beat their last move after losses. This aligns with the strategy:
     - After a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - After a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - After a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round.

Given these observations, the opponent's strategy seems to be best described by the following:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict the opponent will play rock again.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays of rock, paper, and scissors don't seem to follow a simple pattern of always choosing the move that beats or loses to my last move. 
   - The opponent's moves don't consistently match the move that would beat or lose to their own last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After winning (e.g., round 34, 41, 46, 52), the opponent doesn't consistently play the same move or the move that would beat their last move.
   - After losing (e.g., round 35, 36, 38, 43), the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that would beat their last move.
   - After ties (e.g., round 33, 39, 44, 47), the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move" doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that beats my last move.
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move" doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently repeat my last move.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently follow this pattern.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently follow this pattern.
   - The complex strategy involving transitions based on both the previous outcome and transition seems too complex given the observed behavior.

Given the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems closest to the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move." This is because there are instances where the opponent's move seems to lose to their previous move, although not consistently.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would lose to their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'rock', their next move is likely to be 'scissors' (since scissors would lose to rock).

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            You last played: rock

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {66: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.6444422479649956, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.5814695495980506, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 82: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided interaction history:

1. **Identify Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves after each round are as follows:
     - Round 82: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'paper', I won.
     - Round 83: Opponent played 'paper', I played 'rock', opponent won.
   - The opponent's move in round 83 was 'paper', which beats my 'rock' from round 82.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After losing in round 82, the opponent played 'paper' in round 83, which beats their previous move 'rock'.
   - This suggests that after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent's behavior after a loss matches the strategy: "After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
   - The opponent's behavior after a win or tie is not fully clear from the limited data, but the observed behavior aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that beats their last move.

Given the observed behavior, the strategy that best fits is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and won. To beat their last move (paper), they would play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round ended in a tie with both playing rock, I predict that the opponent will play rock again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of rock, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.8257767015028479, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played rock and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter their move and win the round.

  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.9795028031551085, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'paper' next to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter it and win the round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {66: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.3899563735460032, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - When I played 'rock' and they played 'paper', they won. In the next round, they played 'rock' (round 67 to 68).
   - When I played 'scissors' and they played 'rock', they won. In the next round, they played 'rock' again (round 68 to 69).
   - When I played 'rock' and they played 'paper', they won. In the next round, they played 'rock' (round 69 to 70).
   - When I played 'scissors' and they played 'rock', they won. In the next round, they played 'scissors' (round 70 to 71).
   - When I played 'scissors' and they played 'scissors', it was a tie. In the next round, they played 'scissors' (round 71 to 72).
   - When I played 'paper' and they played 'scissors', they won. In the next round, they played 'rock' (round 72 to 73).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, they often repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, they sometimes repeat the same move.
   - After a loss, they tend to switch to a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern where after a win, they either repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, they switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, they sometimes repeat the same move.

The strategy that best fits this behavior is:
- After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

This strategy aligns with the observed behavior, where the opponent often repeats their move after a tie and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a win or loss.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it would beat their last move 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to repeat moves after ties (e.g., rounds 54, 63, 64, 65, 80, 81, 84, 94).
   - After losses, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 53 to 54, 67 to 68, 69 to 70).
   - After wins, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 48 to 49, 55 to 56, 56 to 57).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie, the opponent often repeats their move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit some of the patterns, but not consistently.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" aligns more closely with the observed behavior, especially with the repetition after ties and the switch after losses.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted rock play, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that beats or loses to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., round 54 to 55: rock to rock).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 52 to 53: scissors to paper).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., round 54 to 55: rock to rock).

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit some of the observed patterns.
   - However, the strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." is complex and considers both the outcome and the transition, which might explain the variability in the opponent's moves.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the strategy that considers both the outcome and the previous transition seems to best fit the observed patterns. This strategy accounts for the different responses after wins, losses, and ties, and the transitions observed in the history.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'paper' and won against the opponent's 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to ensure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it against the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves don't consistently follow a pattern of beating or losing to their own last move or my last move.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move, changes to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move, or mirrors my move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After losing, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After ties, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit some of the observed patterns.
   - However, the strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." is more complex and could explain the variability in the opponent's responses, as it considers both the outcome and the transition type.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the latter strategy seems to best fit the observed patterns. It accounts for different responses based on the combination of the previous outcome and the transition type.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played paper against my scissors), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter-move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best explains their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their winning move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior varies, sometimes repeating their move or switching to a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent tends to repeat their winning move.
   - **Losses:** The opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** The opponent's response is less predictable, but they sometimes switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to align well with the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and sometimes switch to a losing move after a tie.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.8273869773913138, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost to my scissors. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play rock in the next round to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {66: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.27917088417391966, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history and the possible strategies provided.

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For instance, after a loss, they often play the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a win, they sometimes repeat the same move or play the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a tie, they sometimes play the move that would lose to their last round's move or repeat the same move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - **After a Win**: The opponent sometimes plays the same move or the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - **After a Loss**: The opponent often plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - **After a Tie**: The opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last round's move or repeats the same move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the observed behavior, where the opponent adjusts their move based on the outcome of the previous round, particularly focusing on changing their move after a loss and sometimes repeating or changing after a win or tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round as it beats scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

     - Round 99: Opponent played scissors (lost), next round played paper.
     - Round 100: Opponent played paper (won), next round played paper.
     - Round 101: Opponent played paper (tie), next round played paper.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move or repeats the same move.
   - After a loss, the opponent frequently plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent tends to repeat the same move or plays the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Given this analysis, the opponent's strategy is most consistent with the following description:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, the opponent is likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, I should play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently beat, lose to, or match my last move. This suggests that the opponent is not simply mirroring or countering my previous move directly.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., rounds 54-55, 56-57) and sometimes changes (e.g., rounds 55-56, 57-58).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes changes their move (e.g., rounds 53-54, 61-62) and sometimes repeats (e.g., rounds 68-69, 69-70).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., rounds 101-102) and sometimes changes (e.g., rounds 64-65, 79-80).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior is inconsistent with simple strategies like always beating or losing to their last move.
   - The opponent's behavior after ties and losses suggests a more complex strategy that considers both the outcome and possibly their previous transition.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the strategy that best fits is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the nuanced changes in the opponent's moves based on different scenarios.

Thus, the opponent's strategy is likely the one described in the last option, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played paper, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent's next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play scissors, I should play rock to counter this and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they won with paper against my rock. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.8269289292901582, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they play the move that would lose to their last move after a win. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play the move that beats their last move, which is 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors' to win the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they lost the last round with 'rock', they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.9976044736041205, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played rock and I played paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move. Therefore, they are likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies provided.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has played 'paper' against my 'rock' in the last round, resulting in a loss for me.
   - In previous rounds, the opponent's moves have varied, but there are instances where they play moves that beat my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning (e.g., round 83, opponent played 'paper' against my 'rock'), the opponent played 'rock' in the next round, which would lose to their previous move 'paper'.
   - After losing (e.g., round 74, opponent played 'scissors' against my 'rock'), the opponent played 'rock' in the next round, which would beat their previous move 'scissors'.
   - After ties (e.g., round 79, both played 'scissors'), the opponent played 'rock' in the next round, which would beat their previous move 'scissors'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to change their move based on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically:
     - After a win, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - After a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - After a tie, they play the move that would beat their last round's move.

This pattern aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

Therefore, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round, as 'rock' would lose to 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.4685925124457626, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 122: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves are consistently beaten by my moves, suggesting a predictable pattern.
   - The opponent's moves do not seem to be random, as they often result in my wins.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or changes it.
   - After a loss, the opponent's behavior seems to change, but not consistently in a way that beats my last move.
   - After ties, the opponent's behavior does not show a clear pattern of switching to a move that would beat or lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's moves often seem to be the same as my previous move, which suggests they might be mirroring my last move.
   - However, this is not consistent enough to be the sole strategy.
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently follow the pattern of playing a move that would beat or lose to their last move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:
- "The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move."

This strategy explains why the opponent's moves are often beaten by mine, as they are mirroring my previous move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and since I played 'paper' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves after each round can be observed to see if they follow a specific pattern.
   - We need to check if the opponent's move is consistently beating, losing to, or matching their previous move or my previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - We need to see if the opponent's behavior changes after a win, loss, or tie.
   - For example, after a win, do they repeat the move, switch to a move that would beat their last move, or switch to a move that would lose to their last move?

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - We will compare the opponent's moves with each strategy to see which one aligns best with their observed behavior.

**Step-by-step Analysis**:

- **Rounds 74-123**:
  - The opponent's moves and outcomes are given. We need to see if there's a consistent pattern in their responses.
  - For example, if the opponent plays 'scissors' after playing 'paper' and losing, they might be following a strategy that changes based on the outcome.

- **Checking Strategies**:
  - **Strategy 1**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
    - This would mean if they played 'rock', they would play 'paper' next. This doesn't consistently match the history.
  - **Strategy 2**: The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
    - This would mean if they played 'rock', they would play 'scissors' next. This doesn't consistently match the history.
  - **Strategy 3**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
    - This would mean if I played 'rock', they would play 'paper' next. This doesn't consistently match the history.
  - **Strategy 4**: The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
    - This would mean if I played 'rock', they would play 'rock' next. This doesn't consistently match the history.
  - **Strategy 5**: After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
    - This strategy seems to match some of the patterns observed, but not consistently.
  - **Strategy 6**: After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
    - This strategy doesn't consistently match the observed behavior.
  - **Strategy 7**: The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
    - This strategy is complex and considers multiple factors. It might explain the variability in the opponent's moves.

**Conclusion**:
Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to be best explained by Strategy 7, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the variability and complexity observed in the opponent's moves.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round where they played 'paper' against my 'scissors'. According to their strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (which was 'paper' against my 'scissors'), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be to play paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.9693654158433985, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }
            ```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and evaluate each potential strategy:

1. **The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.**
   - This strategy would mean that if the opponent played 'rock' in the previous round, they would play 'paper' in the next round. However, this doesn't align with the observed moves, as the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that beats their last move.

2. **The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.**
   - This strategy would mean that if the opponent played 'rock' in the previous round, they would play 'scissors' in the next round. This also doesn't match the observed behavior.

3. **The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.**
   - This strategy suggests that the opponent is trying to predict and counter our last move. For example, if we played 'rock', they would play 'paper'. This aligns with some rounds but not consistently.

4. **The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.**
   - This strategy would mean the opponent mirrors our last move. This doesn't match the observed behavior, as they don't consistently mirror our moves.

5. **After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.**
   - This strategy involves different responses based on the outcome. However, the opponent doesn't consistently follow this pattern after wins, losses, or ties.

6. **After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.**
   - This strategy also involves different responses based on the outcome. The opponent doesn't consistently follow this pattern either.

7. **The opponent's transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.**
   - This strategy is complex and considers both the outcome and the transition. Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's moves, this strategy might best explain their behavior. The opponent's moves seem to be influenced by both the outcome of the previous round and their previous move, which aligns with this strategy.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior is best explained by the last strategy, which considers both the outcome and the previous transition. Therefore, the selected strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and the opponent played scissors, resulting in my loss. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round, my best counter-move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but we need to check if there's a consistent pattern in how they respond to my moves.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - Let's examine the recent rounds to see if the opponent's moves change based on the outcome of the previous round.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - **Round 131:** I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors', I lost.
     - Next round (132), opponent played 'paper'.
     - If they lost, they might play the move that beats their last move ('rock'), but they played 'paper' instead.
   - **Round 132:** I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper', it was a tie.
     - Next round (133), we need to predict their move.

4. **Strategy Matching:**
   - Let's consider the strategies:
     - **Strategy 1:** Plays the move that would beat their last move.
       - Doesn't fit as they played 'paper' after 'scissors' (should have been 'rock').
     - **Strategy 2:** Plays the move that would lose to their last move.
       - Doesn't fit as they played 'paper' after 'scissors' (should have been 'scissors').
     - **Strategy 3:** Plays the move that would beat my last move.
       - Fits for round 131 to 132 transition ('scissors' beats 'paper', then 'paper' beats 'rock').
     - **Strategy 4:** Plays the same move as my last move.
       - Doesn't fit as they didn't play 'paper' after my 'paper' in round 131.
     - **Strategy 5:** After a win, plays the same move; after a loss, plays the move that beats their last move; after a tie, plays the move that would lose to their last move.
       - Doesn't fit as they didn't play 'rock' after losing with 'scissors'.
     - **Strategy 6:** After a win, plays the move that would beat their last move; after a loss, plays the move that would lose to their last move; after a tie, plays the same move.
       - Doesn't fit as they didn't play 'scissors' after losing with 'scissors'.
     - **Strategy 7:** Complex transition strategy based on previous outcomes and transitions.
       - Too complex for the observed pattern.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior from round 131 to 132 fits **Strategy 3**: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the given strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats the same move or plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses:** The opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** The opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" does not fully match the observed behavior.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" aligns more closely with the observed behavior.

Given the analysis, the opponent's behavior most closely matches the strategy where they repeat their move after a win, play the move that beats their last move after a loss, and play the move that loses to their last move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors and I played rock), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Response to Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After winning, the opponent tends to repeat their move or choose a move that would beat their last move.
   - After losing, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's response is less predictable but sometimes they repeat their move or choose a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior varies, but they sometimes repeat their move or choose a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategy:**
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy accounts for the observed behavior where the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a winning move after a loss, and sometimes chooses a losing move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played rock and I played paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter-move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {122: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.026255110131509996, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch strategies after certain outcomes.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their previous move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit some of the observed patterns.
   - However, the strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." is more complex and accounts for multiple scenarios, including transitions based on both the outcome and the move two rounds ago.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the latter strategy seems to best explain the observed moves, as it accounts for transitions based on both outcomes and previous transitions.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both my opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to my understanding of the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent's next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it against the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they play the move that beats my last move. For example, in round 136, I played 'paper' and they played 'scissors', which beats 'paper'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 94 and 95, both 'rock').
   - After a loss, they sometimes play the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 93 to 94, they lost with 'rock' against 'paper' and then played 'rock' again, which doesn't fit this pattern).
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less clear, but they sometimes repeat their move (e.g., round 135 and 136, both 'scissors').

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior doesn't consistently match any single strategy perfectly. However, the strategy that involves changing moves based on the outcome (win, lose, tie) and sometimes repeating moves seems to fit some of the observed patterns.

The strategy that best fits the observed behavior is:
- After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move.
- After a loss, they sometimes play the move that would beat their last move.
- After a tie, they sometimes repeat their move.

This aligns with the strategy:
"After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Let's select this strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best explains their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they play the move that would beat my last move. For example, in round 137, I played 'rock', and they played 'paper', which beats 'rock'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move. For instance, in round 93, they won with 'paper' against my 'rock', and in round 94, they played 'rock' again, which is the same move they played in round 93.
   - After a loss, they sometimes play the move that would beat their last move. For example, in round 121, they lost with 'paper' against my 'rock', and in round 122, they played 'rock', which beats 'paper'.
   - After a tie, their behavior is less consistent, but there are instances where they play the move that would lose to their last move. For example, in round 135, they tied with 'scissors', and in round 136, they played 'paper', which loses to 'scissors'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior quite well.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after winning the last round with paper against my rock, they are likely to play the same move again, which is paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my best move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last move. For example, in round 138, they played 'rock' after losing with 'scissors' in round 137.
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move, but this isn't consistent enough to be a definitive pattern.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior seems less predictable, but they sometimes play the move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Change Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a win, the opponent's behavior is less consistent, but they sometimes repeat the same move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is inconsistent, but they sometimes play the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior best.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to play the move that would beat their last move after a loss and sometimes repeat the same move after a win.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper' to secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and won. According to their strategy, they will play the move that would lose to 'scissors', which is 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be to play paper.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.37937235431078375, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the given history and the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves after ties, wins, and losses need to be examined to see if there's a consistent pattern.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Ties:** In the last round (146), both played 'paper', resulting in a tie. The opponent played 'paper' again. This could suggest that after a tie, they play the same move as the previous round.
   - **Wins:** Looking at rounds where the opponent won, such as round 137 (opponent played 'paper' against my 'rock'), the next move was 'rock' in round 138, which would lose to their previous move. This suggests that after a win, they might play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - **Losses:** In round 121, the opponent lost with 'paper' against my 'rock', and in the next round (122), they played 'rock', which would beat their previous move. This suggests that after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Given this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie and they played 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays:
     - Round 146: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper' (tie).
     - Round 147: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper' (I won).
   - The opponent's response to my moves:
     - After a tie (round 146), the opponent played 'paper' again in round 147.
     - After losing (round 147), we need to predict their next move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a tie, the opponent repeated their move ('paper').
   - After a loss, we need to predict their next move to determine the strategy.

3. **Strategy Comparison:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This doesn't match as they played 'paper' after 'paper' (tie).
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't match as they played 'paper' after 'paper' (tie).
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't match as they played 'paper' after I played 'paper' (tie).
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't match as they played 'paper' after I played 'scissors' (win).
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move; after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move; after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't match as they played 'paper' after a tie.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move; after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move; after a tie, they play the same move.
     - This matches as they played 'paper' after a tie (round 146) and 'paper' after a win (round 147).

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns with Strategy 6. They repeated their move after a tie and played the same move after a win.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost to my scissors. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round, as rock would lose to paper, which was their last move.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.695892453612284, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 147: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.36677937261037424, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to the move that would beat their last move. For example, in round 148, they played 'scissors' after losing with 'scissors' in round 147.
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move, as seen in rounds 104-105 and 106-107.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less consistent but sometimes switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior:
     - After wins, they often repeat the same move.
     - After losses, they switch to a move that would beat their last move.
     - After ties, they sometimes switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent won with 'paper'. According to their strategy, they should play 'rock' next, as it would lose to 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'rock', I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.8509873022700192, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost, so they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.9957907601104562, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors in the next round to beat their previous move of paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter-move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.3970535320773193, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 148: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there is a noticeable pattern where they often play a move that would beat their previous move. For example, if they played 'rock', they might play 'paper' next.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, they often play a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, they sometimes play a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to fit some of the observed behavior but not all.
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move" aligns well with the pattern of the opponent often playing a move that would beat their previous move, regardless of the outcome.

Given the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move." This strategy predicts their moves most accurately based on the observed pattern of frequently choosing a move that would beat their previous move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves based on the provided history and the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For example, when I played 'scissors' and they played 'rock' in round 162, they won. In round 161, both played 'rock', resulting in a tie. In round 160, I played 'scissors' and they played 'paper', resulting in my win. This suggests they may change their strategy based on the outcome.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (round 162), the opponent played 'rock', which would beat 'scissors' if I repeated my move from round 162.
   - After a tie (round 161), the opponent played 'rock', which would beat 'scissors' if I repeated my move from round 160.
   - After a loss (round 160), the opponent played 'rock', which would beat 'scissors' if I repeated my move from round 160.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play the move that would beat my last move after a win, a tie, or a loss. This aligns with the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move, and I played scissors last, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. According to their strategy, they will play the move that would lose to scissors, which is paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter-move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'paper' next to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.9652413359877287, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.3756689351914101, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 163: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.2217080099999999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays don't seem to follow a simple pattern like always playing the move that beats or loses to their last move or my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 122 to 123, 124 to 125) or switches to a move that beats their last move (e.g., round 125 to 126).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 170 to 171).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 135 to 136) or switches to a move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 161 to 162).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be influenced by both the outcome of the previous round and their previous move. This suggests a more complex strategy that considers both the outcome and the transition they made in the previous round.
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "The opponent's transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..."

This strategy accounts for the observed behavior where the opponent's next move is influenced by both the outcome of the previous round and the transition they made in that round.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'rock', the move that beats 'rock' is 'paper'. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter move is 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For example, after a win, they sometimes repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where their response depends on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically, they tend to repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and switch to a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- **After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.**

This strategy explains the observed patterns in the opponent's moves based on the outcomes of previous rounds.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to play paper next, as paper would lose to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has played scissors in the last two rounds, resulting in ties. This suggests they might not be changing their move after a tie.
   - Before these ties, the opponent played rock against my scissors, resulting in a win for them.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning with rock against my scissors in round 170, the opponent played scissors in round 171, which resulted in a tie.
   - After the tie in round 171, the opponent played scissors again in round 172, resulting in another tie.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior after a win (playing scissors after winning with rock) and after ties (playing the same move, scissors, again) suggests they might be following a specific pattern.
   - The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the opponent's behavior: after winning with rock, they switched to scissors (which beats rock), and after ties, they repeated the same move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict the opponent will play scissors again.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the potential strategies.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to the previous round's outcome and their own previous move.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win (e.g., round 131 to 132, where they played 'paper' after winning with 'scissors').

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** After winning, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 131 to 132) or switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 134 to 135, where they played 'rock' after winning with 'paper').
   - **Losses:** After losing, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 137 to 138, where they played 'scissors' after losing with 'rock').
   - **Ties:** After ties, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 135 to 136, where they played 'scissors' again after a tie) or switches to a move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 161 to 162, where they played 'scissors' after a tie with 'rock').

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with a strategy where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and their previous transition. This is evident from the mixed responses after wins, losses, and ties, showing a complex pattern rather than a simple repetitive one.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is the most complex one, where transitions depend on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played scissors and lost to my rock. According to their strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter move is paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their winning move.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent tends to repeat the winning move.
   - **Losses:** The opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** The opponent sometimes switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior.

Let's verify this with a few examples from the history:
- **Round 131:** Loss for the opponent (they played scissors, I played paper). In round 132, they played paper (which would lose to their last move, scissors).
- **Round 135:** Tie (both played scissors). In round 136, they played scissors again (same move).
- **Round 140:** Win for the opponent (they played rock, I played scissors). In round 141, they played paper (which would beat their last move, rock).

The observed behavior aligns well with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Thus, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python

```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played rock and I played paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best move to counter this would be scissors.

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move is 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.9899523020430844, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.9988178983830669, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies provided:

1. **Observing Patterns:**
   - In round 191, the opponent played 'paper' against my 'rock', resulting in a win for them. 
   - In round 190, the opponent played 'paper' against my 'scissors', resulting in a loss for them.
   - In round 189, the opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper', resulting in a loss for them.
   - In round 188, the opponent played 'scissors' against my 'rock', resulting in a loss for them.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win (round 191), the opponent played 'paper', which is the same move as the previous round (round 190).
   - After a loss (round 190), the opponent played 'paper', which would beat their previous move 'rock' (round 189).
   - After a loss (round 189), the opponent played 'rock', which would beat their previous move 'scissors' (round 188).
   - After a loss (round 188), the opponent played 'scissors', which would beat their previous move 'rock' (round 187).

3. **Matching with Strategies:**
   - The opponent seems to play the same move after a win.
   - After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - This pattern matches with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Based on the analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won, so they are likely to play 'paper' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.46943225661732046, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less consistent, but there are instances where they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - **After a Win:** The opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - **After a Loss:** The opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - **After a Tie:** The opponent's behavior is less consistent, but there are instances where they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy seems to predict the opponent's observed moves most accurately, given the patterns identified in their responses to wins, losses, and ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous move of 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {193: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.028602579632124314, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it against the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat their previous move or choose a move that would beat or lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes changes their move to one that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy that considers both the outcome of the previous round and the transition they made. This is evident from the varied responses after wins, losses, and ties, which sometimes involve repeating moves, choosing moves that would beat their last move, or choosing moves that would lose to their last move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the observed variability in the opponent's responses to different outcomes.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter would be to play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move. 
   - For instance, in round 191, the opponent played 'paper' against my 'rock', which they won. In the next round (192), they played 'rock', which would lose to their previous 'paper'. This suggests a possible pattern of playing a move that would lose to their last move after a win.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would lose to their last move, as seen in rounds 191 to 192.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to play a move that would beat their last move, as seen in rounds 192 to 193, where they lost with 'rock' and then played 'paper' which beats 'rock'.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less clear, but there are instances where they repeat the same move.

3. **Matching Strategy:**
   - The strategy that best fits these observations is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the observed behavior where the opponent sometimes plays a move that would lose to their last move after a win and a move that would beat their last move after a loss.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter this and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary depending on the outcome of the previous round (win, loss, or tie).
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move, changes to a move that would beat their last move, or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - **Wins**: After winning, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses**: After losing, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties**: After ties, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where their response depends on both the previous outcome and their previous transition. This is evident from the varied responses after wins, losses, and ties, as well as the influence of their previous move.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is the one where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This strategy accounts for the observed variability in their responses.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and won against the opponent's rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (rock vs paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent has shown a tendency to play 'paper' after I play 'scissors', as seen in the last round and several previous rounds. Given this pattern, I predict their next play will likely be 'rock' to counter my 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my best move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9200012454237978, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's move in round 201 was 'rock' after losing with 'rock' in round 200. This suggests they might be repeating their move after a loss.
   - In round 200, they played 'rock' after losing with 'scissors' in round 199, which could indicate a switch to a move that beats their previous move.
   - In round 199, they played 'scissors' after losing with 'paper' in round 198, suggesting they switched to a move that beats their previous move.
   - In round 198, they played 'paper' after winning with 'scissors' in round 197, indicating they repeated their winning move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move (e.g., rounds 197 to 198).
   - After a loss, they tend to switch to a move that beats their previous move (e.g., rounds 199 to 200).
   - After a tie, there is limited data, but they might switch to a move that beats their previous move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior:
     - After wins, they repeat the move.
     - After losses, they switch to a move that beats their previous move.
     - After ties, they might switch to a move that would lose to their previous move (though this is less clear due to limited tie data).

Given this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', their likely play in the next round is 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.5408006102576609, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 193: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.4659, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response:**
   - The opponent's moves after each round seem to be reactive to the previous round's outcome.
   - For example, in round 202, the opponent played 'scissors' after I played 'paper' in round 201, which resulted in a loss for me. This suggests they might be playing the move that beats my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last move. For instance, in round 191, the opponent played 'paper' after winning with 'paper' in round 190.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to play the move that would beat my last move. For example, in round 162, they played 'rock' after losing with 'rock' in round 161.
   - After a tie, the opponent seems to play the move that would lose to their last move. For instance, in round 171, they played 'scissors' after tying with 'scissors' in round 170.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

This strategy aligns with the observed behavior in the interaction history, where the opponent's moves seem to be influenced by the outcome of the previous round.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win or a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat their last move 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it against the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response:**
   - The opponent's moves are not consistently the same as their previous move, nor are they consistently the move that would beat or lose to their previous move. This rules out the first two strategies.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome:**
   - After a win, the opponent does not consistently repeat their move or play the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent does not consistently play the move that would beat their last move or lose to it.
   - After a tie, the opponent does not consistently play the same move or the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be influenced by both the outcome of the previous round and their previous transition. This suggests a more complex strategy.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's moves, the most fitting strategy is the last one, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the observed behavior where the opponent's move seems to depend on both the result of the last round and the move they made relative to two rounds ago.

Therefore, the best explanation for the opponent's behavior is the strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move in the last round as they did two rounds ago, the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since the opponent played 'paper' in the last two rounds, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.8424946093183777, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best move to counter this would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and given that I played 'paper' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9814696482916978, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9936440893640524, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's move in the last round was 'paper', which beat my 'rock'. This resulted in a win for them.
   - In the previous rounds, when I played 'rock', the opponent played 'scissors' (round 213), 'rock' (round 211), and 'scissors' (round 210). This indicates variability in their response to 'rock'.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After winning (e.g., round 191, 204), the opponent played 'rock' and 'paper', respectively. This suggests they don't always repeat the winning move.
   - After losing (e.g., round 170, 192), the opponent played 'scissors' and 'paper', respectively. This suggests they might switch to a move that beats their previous one.
   - After ties (e.g., round 171, 203), the opponent played 'scissors' and 'rock', respectively. This suggests they might switch to a move that beats their previous one.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to change based on the outcome of the previous round. They don't consistently play the same move after a win, loss, or tie.
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Given this analysis, the strategy that most accurately predicts the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, since they won the last round by playing paper against my rock, they will likely play the move that beats their last move, which is scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.57781992265187, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 195: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.475032133136282, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to play moves that would beat their previous move, especially after losses. For example, after they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper' in round 169, they played 'rock' again in round 170, which would beat their previous 'rock' if I had played it again.
   - After ties, like in round 217 where both played 'rock', the opponent played 'rock' again, which would lose to their last move if repeated.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** After winning, the opponent sometimes repeats the winning move or plays the move that would beat their last move. For example, after winning with 'scissors' against 'paper' in round 175, they played 'rock' in round 176, which would beat 'scissors'.
   - **Losses:** After losses, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move. For instance, after losing with 'scissors' against 'rock' in round 170, they played 'scissors' again in round 171, which would beat 'rock'.
   - **Ties:** After ties, the opponent tends to play the move that would lose to their last move, as seen in round 217 where they played 'rock' again after a tie with 'rock'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to play rock again.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has shown a mix of repeating their move and changing it. For example, in rounds 219 and 220, they played 'paper' and then 'rock', which doesn't directly follow a simple pattern of repeating or countering my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 191), the opponent played 'rock' after winning with 'paper'. This suggests they might not always repeat their winning move.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 201), the opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'scissors'. This indicates they might switch to a move that could beat my last move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 220), they played 'rock' again after tying with 'rock', which suggests they might repeat or change based on a more complex rule.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's moves don't consistently follow a simple pattern like always beating or losing to their last move. Instead, their behavior seems to depend on both the outcome and possibly the transition they made in the previous round.
   - The complex strategy described in the last option seems to fit their behavior, as it accounts for different transitions based on both the outcome and the previous transition.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the complex one where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played 'rock', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent's next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter-move should be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's move in round 221 was 'rock' after I played 'scissors' in round 220. This resulted in a win for them.
   - In round 220, the opponent played 'rock' after I played 'rock' in round 219, resulting in a tie.
   - In round 219, the opponent played 'paper' after I played 'scissors' in round 218, resulting in a loss for them.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (round 221), the opponent played 'rock' again, which is the same move as their last round.
   - After a tie (round 220), the opponent played 'rock', which is the same move as their last round.
   - After a loss (round 219), the opponent played 'rock', which is the move that would beat their last round's move ('paper').

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win or a tie, and switch to a move that would beat their last round's move after a loss.
   - This behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.
   - There are sequences where the opponent plays a move that would beat their last move, suggesting a pattern.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After wins, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After losses, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After ties, the opponent sometimes repeats the move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to align with the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to switch moves after losses and ties and to sometimes repeat moves after ties.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my previous moves, but not in a straightforward manner. They don't consistently play the move that would beat or lose to my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent's next move doesn't consistently follow a pattern of repeating the same move or choosing a move that would beat or lose to their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent's next move also doesn't consistently follow a pattern of repeating, beating, or losing to their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's next move doesn't consistently repeat, beat, or lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior doesn't fit neatly into the simpler strategies like always beating or losing to their last move, or repeating the same move.
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be more complex and possibly depends on both the outcome of the previous round and the transition they made from two rounds ago.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the strategy that best fits their behavior is the most complex one provided, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'scissors' and won against the opponent's 'paper'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter-move is 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the potential strategies provided:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's responses seem to vary based on the outcome of the previous round (win, loss, or tie).
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the same move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - The opponent's behavior changes based on the outcome of the previous round. For example:
     - After winning with 'rock' against 'scissors', they might play 'rock' again or switch to 'paper'.
     - After losing with 'rock' against 'paper', they might switch to 'scissors'.
     - After a tie with 'scissors' against 'scissors', they might switch to 'rock'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is the one where the opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made.
   - This strategy accounts for the variability in their responses after wins, losses, and ties, and matches the observed patterns in the interaction history.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that most accurately predicts the opponent's behavior is the complex strategy where the opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played scissors and won. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter-move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.7946018777528248, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last move, and considering that I played 'scissors' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9295484440692189, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as my last move, and considering that I played 'scissors' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent seems to switch between moves that beat or lose to their previous move. For instance, in round 231, they played 'paper' after playing 'scissors' in round 230, which beats 'rock' (my play in round 231).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the observed moves most accurately, as it accounts for the opponent's tendency to switch moves based on the outcome of the previous round.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their last move 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.5454787375939173, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 195: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.4338370978304101, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history and the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently follow a pattern of playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move. For example, in round 231, they played 'paper' after playing 'rock' in round 230, which doesn't fit the pattern of playing a move that beats or loses to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 229 to 230: 'rock' to 'rock') and sometimes changes (e.g., round 230 to 231: 'rock' to 'paper').
   - After a loss, they sometimes change their move to one that would beat their last move (e.g., round 231 to 232: 'paper' to 'rock').
   - After a tie, they sometimes repeat their move (e.g., round 217 to 218: 'rock' to 'rock').

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to fit the strategy where after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round.

Given the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to play moves that result in ties, as seen in rounds 203, 223, and 233 where both players played the same move.
   - There are instances where the opponent's move would lose to my previous move, such as in round 191 (opponent played paper, I played rock) and round 216 (opponent played paper, I played rock).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move, as seen in rounds 184-185 (opponent played paper, then scissors).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would beat their last move, such as in round 191 (opponent played paper after losing with paper).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the same move again, as seen in rounds 203-204 (opponent played paper twice).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."
   - This strategy explains the observed patterns: repeating moves after wins, changing to a winning move after losses, and sometimes losing moves after ties.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played 'paper', which means the opponent's next move should be 'rock', as 'rock' loses to 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as 'paper' beats 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and switch to a losing move after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the following strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper', so they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', I should play 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best explains their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently follow a pattern of playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move. For example, they don't always play the move that would beat their previous move or the move that would lose to it.
   - The opponent does not consistently play the move that would beat my last move or the same move as my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 186-187, 188-189) and sometimes changes it (e.g., rounds 189-190, 190-191).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., rounds 191-192) and sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 201-202).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 203-204, 217-218) and sometimes changes it (e.g., rounds 233-234, 234-235).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be influenced by the outcome of the previous round (win, loss, or tie) and possibly by the transition they made in the previous round.
   - The most complex strategy, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition, seems to fit the observed behavior. This strategy accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses after wins, losses, and ties.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. Therefore, the selected strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played paper, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my best counter-move is to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves don't consistently beat, lose to, or match my last move. This rules out strategies that rely solely on my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - The opponent's behavior after wins, losses, and ties seems to vary, suggesting a more complex strategy than simply repeating or countering their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies to Observed Behavior:**
   - The opponent doesn't consistently play the move that would beat or lose to their last move, ruling out the first two strategies.
   - The opponent doesn't consistently play the move that would beat my last move or match my last move, ruling out the third and fourth strategies.
   - The fifth strategy involves playing the same move after a win, a counter-move after a loss, and a losing move after a tie. This doesn't consistently match the observed behavior.
   - The sixth strategy involves playing a counter-move after a win, a losing move after a loss, and the same move after a tie. This doesn't consistently match the observed behavior.
   - The seventh strategy is complex and considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy could potentially explain the varied responses after wins, losses, and ties, as it accounts for multiple factors.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the seventh strategy seems to best fit the observed pattern. It accounts for different responses based on the outcome and the previous transition, which aligns with the opponent's inconsistent responses to wins, losses, and ties.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played 'rock', resulting in a tie. According to my understanding of the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'rock' in the last round, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'paper' in the next round, my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 237: opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'rock' in round 236).
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., round 228: opponent won with 'scissors' and played 'scissors' again in round 229).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 217: opponent tied with 'rock' and played 'rock' again in round 218).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior:
     - After a win, the opponent often repeats the same move.
     - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
     - After a tie, the opponent often switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.5516840279991868, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history and the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For example, after they win, they often play the move that would beat their last move. After they lose, they often play the move that would beat their last move. After ties, their behavior is less consistent.

2. **Behavior Changes Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last move. For instance, in round 191, they played 'paper' after winning with 'rock' in round 190.
   - After a loss, they seem to play the move that would beat their last move. For example, in round 192, they played 'rock' after losing with 'paper' in round 191.
   - After ties, they sometimes repeat the same move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to align with the observed behavior. However, the opponent does not always play the same move after a tie.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" also aligns with the observed behavior, especially after wins and losses.

Given the analysis, the opponent's behavior most closely matches the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last move after both wins and losses, and play the move that would lose to their last move after ties. Therefore, the chosen strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.6861788195994307, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided interaction history and the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently beat, lose to, or match my last move. For example, in the last few rounds, they played 'paper' against my 'paper' multiple times, resulting in ties.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent does not consistently play the same move or a move that beats or loses to their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent's behavior is inconsistent with any simple pattern of repeating, beating, or losing to their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior also does not consistently follow a simple pattern.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be complex and does not fit neatly into the simpler strategies listed. 
   - The most complex strategy, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition, might explain the observed behavior. This strategy involves different responses based on the combination of the previous outcome and the transition made.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's moves, the strategy that best fits their behavior is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy allows for a more nuanced response that could explain the lack of a simple pattern in their moves.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played paper, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie in which the opponent played the same move as they did two rounds ago, the opponent will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, I should play rock to counter their move and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.18032517371960155, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 239: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to repeat moves or switch based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - For example, in rounds 191 and 192, the opponent played 'paper' and then 'rock', which beat my 'rock' and 'scissors', respectively. This suggests a possible pattern of playing the move that would beat their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that seems to fit the opponent's behavior is the one where they change their move based on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically, they tend to play the move that would beat their last move after a win, and play the move that would lose to their last move after a tie. This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both of us playing 'rock', I predict that the opponent will play 'rock' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, with no consistent pattern of repeating the same move or directly countering my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** When the opponent wins, they sometimes repeat their move or switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses:** After losing, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** After ties, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent does not consistently play the move that would beat or lose to their last move.
   - They do not consistently play the move that would beat or match my last move.
   - The opponent's behavior changes based on the outcome of the previous round, which suggests a more complex strategy.

4. **Best-Fitting Strategy:**
   - The strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to fit well. This strategy involves different responses based on whether the opponent won, lost, or tied, and how they transitioned from the round before last to the last round.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses and their adjustments based on the outcome of the previous round.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my previous move, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter move is 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary based on the outcome of the previous round. For example, after a win, they often repeat the move or choose a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After ties, their behavior seems inconsistent, sometimes repeating the move or switching to a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent sometimes repeats the move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses:** The opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** The opponent's behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes repeat the move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after wins, switch to a winning move after losses, and sometimes choose a losing move after ties.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played scissors and won against the opponent's paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors in the next round to beat my last move, which was scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round, my best counter move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9035660763629374, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and considering that I played 'rock' in the last round, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last move, and considering that I played 'rock' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.3886546453180233, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For instance, when I played 'rock' and lost to 'paper', the opponent played 'paper' again in the next round (round 216 to 217 and round 252 to 253). This suggests that after winning, the opponent might repeat their move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 204 to 205, 231 to 232), the opponent seems to repeat their winning move.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 221 to 222, 237 to 238), the opponent changes their move to one that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 203 to 204, 233 to 234), the opponent seems to repeat their move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the opponent's behavior in the interaction history, as they tend to repeat their move after a win or a tie and switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.

Therefore, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict that their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.5720582517226163, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history and the possible strategies provided.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that beats or loses to their previous move.
   - For example, in round 253, the opponent played 'rock' after I played 'scissors' in round 252. This resulted in their win.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 217 to 218, where they played 'rock' after winning with 'rock').
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 221 to 222, where they switched from 'rock' to 'scissors' after losing).
   - After a tie, they sometimes repeat their move (e.g., round 232 to 233, where they played 'rock' again after a tie).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they sometimes repeat their move after a win or tie and switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss.
   - This behavior is consistent with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my last move rather than their own. For example, when I played 'paper' and won, they played 'rock' the next round, which is beaten by 'paper'.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays the move that would lose to my last move, such as when I played 'scissors' and they played 'rock' (round 253).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the move that would lose to my last move, indicating a possible pattern of sticking to a losing move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move, suggesting they might be trying to counteract their previous loss.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but there are instances where they repeat the move that would lose to my last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits the observed behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy aligns with the observed patterns, where the opponent seems to adjust their moves based on the outcome of the previous round, particularly focusing on their own last move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it would lose to their last move 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - From rounds 206 to 215, the opponent consistently lost, suggesting they were not adapting effectively to my moves.
   - From round 216 onwards, the opponent's behavior seems to change, with a mix of wins, losses, and ties.

2. **Response to Wins, Losses, and Ties:**
   - After a loss (e.g., round 216), the opponent played 'rock' again in round 217, resulting in a tie. This suggests they might be repeating their move after a loss.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 217), the opponent played 'rock' again in round 218, resulting in a loss. This suggests they might be repeating their move after a tie.
   - After a win (e.g., round 218), the opponent played 'rock' again in round 219, resulting in a loss. This suggests they might be repeating their move after a win.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move regardless of the outcome (win, loss, or tie). This behavior aligns with the strategy where the opponent plays the same move as their last round's move.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is that they play the same move as their last round's move, regardless of the outcome.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their last round's move, and since they played 'paper' in the last round, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.5592159803408574, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 254: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.05700000000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that beats or loses to their previous move.
   - For example, in round 256, the opponent played 'rock' after playing 'rock' in round 255. This suggests they might repeat moves sometimes.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., round 214 to 215, both 'rock' and 'rock').
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that beats their last move (e.g., round 252 to 253, 'rock' to 'scissors').
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., round 217 to 218, both 'rock' and 'rock').

3. **Matching Strategies**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to align with the observed behavior:
     - Wins: Repeats the same move.
     - Losses: Switches to a move that beats their last move.
     - Ties: Sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a losing move.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.6914511862386001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the recent history of moves and outcomes:

1. **Round 256**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lost

2. **Round 257**:
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I lost

3. **Round 258**:
   - My play: Not yet played
   - Opponent's play: Not yet known

Now, let's consider the possible strategies:

- **Strategy 1**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit because the opponent played Scissors after Rock, which doesn't beat Rock.

- **Strategy 2**: The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit because the opponent played Scissors after Rock, which doesn't lose to Rock.

- **Strategy 3**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - This fits because the opponent played Scissors after I played Scissors, which beats Scissors.

- **Strategy 4**: The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit because the opponent played Scissors after I played Scissors, which is the same move.

- **Strategy 5**: After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit because the opponent didn't play Rock again after winning with Rock.

- **Strategy 6**: After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - This doesn't fit because the opponent didn't play Paper after winning with Rock.

- **Strategy 7**: The opponent's transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.
  - This strategy is complex and could potentially fit, but based on the recent rounds, Strategy 3 seems more straightforward and fitting.

Based on the analysis, Strategy 3 seems to best explain the opponent's behavior in the recent rounds. Therefore, the opponent is likely playing the move that would beat my last round's move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move, and I played 'paper' last, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted play of 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.18401583036702007, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 257: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, sometimes repeating their last move, sometimes changing it. This suggests a more complex strategy rather than a simple repetitive pattern.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move and sometimes changes it.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes changes their move to one that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or changes it to one that would lose to their last move.

3. **Comparison with Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit some of the patterns observed, but not consistently.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" also fits some patterns but not consistently.
   - The most complex strategy, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition, seems to fit the observed behavior more accurately. This strategy accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses based on both the outcome and their previous move transition.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the most fitting strategy is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy can explain the observed variability in the opponent's moves.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played 'rock', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move in the last round as two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

Response:

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that beats or loses to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that beats their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that beats their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that loses to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior. This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and switch to a losing move after a tie.

Given the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }
            ```

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.6001677568798398, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For example, after they win, they often repeat the same move or choose a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats the same move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, they tend to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes choose a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to align well with the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win and switch to a winning move after a loss.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after they win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and considering that I played 'rock' in the last round, I predict that the opponent's next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to win the round.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.8040822008711215, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9328001948987946, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and given that I played 'paper' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }
            ```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my previous moves. For example, when I played 'scissors' and they played 'rock', they won. In the next round, they played 'rock' again, which suggests they might be repeating their winning move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their winning move. For instance, after winning with 'rock' against my 'scissors', they played 'rock' again.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move. For example, after losing with 'rock' against my 'paper', they switched to 'scissors'.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less clear, but they sometimes repeat the same move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat winning moves and change moves after a loss to counter their previous move.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by my opponent, I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.5470720955004094, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of their moves and outcomes:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent often plays the move that beats my last move. For example:
     - Round 267: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors' (opponent wins).
     - Round 266: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock' (opponent wins).
     - Round 265: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock' (I win).
     - Round 264: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors' (I win).
   - This suggests the opponent might be playing the move that beats my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to play the move that would beat my last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent also seems to play the move that would beat my last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less clear, but they sometimes play the move that would beat my last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior most accurately. The opponent consistently plays the move that would beat my last move, regardless of whether they won, lost, or tied in the previous round.

Based on this analysis, the most likely strategy the opponent is using is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'paper' last, I predict their next play will be 'scissors' to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {268: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 267: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.08295046685028656, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently beat, lose to, or match their previous moves, ruling out the first two strategies.
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently beat or match my last move, ruling out the third and fourth strategies.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After wins, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, sometimes changes it.
   - After losses, the opponent sometimes changes their move, sometimes repeats it.
   - After ties, the opponent sometimes changes their move, sometimes repeats it.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The fifth strategy suggests that after a win, the opponent repeats their move; after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move; after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last move. This doesn't consistently match the observed behavior.
   - The sixth strategy suggests that after a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last move; after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last move; after a tie, they repeat their move. This also doesn't consistently match the observed behavior.
   - The seventh strategy is complex and considers both the outcome and the previous transition. This strategy seems to match the observed behavior more closely, as the opponent's responses vary based on both the outcome and their previous move.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the seventh strategy best explains their behavior. It accounts for the observed transitions and outcomes more accurately than the other strategies.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where their move would lose to my move two rounds ago, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to beat their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their previous move after a win (e.g., round 229 to 230: opponent played rock, then paper after winning).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 231 to 232: opponent played paper, then rock after losing).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with a strategy where they change their move based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - Specifically, the strategy where "after a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win, and changes their move after a loss.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 229 to 230: opponent plays 'rock' after winning with 'rock').
   - After a loss, the opponent often changes their move to one that would beat their last move (e.g., round 231: opponent plays 'paper' after losing with 'rock').
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 233 to 234: opponent plays 'paper' after a tie with 'paper').

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The strategy that best fits the observed behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

This strategy explains the opponent's behavior in the interaction history, as it accounts for the observed patterns of repeating moves after wins, changing to a winning move after losses, and playing a losing move after ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, and there isn't a straightforward pattern of repeating or countering my last move directly.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the same move or a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be influenced by both the outcome of the previous round and their own previous move.
   - The strategy that accounts for the opponent's transition based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to fit well. This strategy involves complex transitions based on the combination of the previous outcome and the move they played relative to my move two rounds ago.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the strategy that best explains their behavior is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy is described as:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, the last round was a tie with both playing rock. According to the strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, I should play scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Identifying Patterns:**
   - The opponent's moves after each round seem to be influenced by the outcome of the previous round (win, lose, or tie).
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move, changes to a move that would beat their last move, or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **After Wins:** The opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **After Losses:** The opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **After Ties:** The opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching to Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after wins, switch to a winning move after losses, and switch to a losing move after ties.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the following strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.5518714849635277, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's move after my play of 'paper' in round 273 was 'scissors', which beats 'paper'. This suggests they might be playing a move that beats my last move.
   - Looking at previous rounds, when I played 'rock' in round 272, they played 'rock', resulting in a tie. In round 271, I played 'rock', and they also played 'rock', resulting in a tie. This suggests they might sometimes mirror my move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning in round 273 (opponent played 'scissors' against my 'paper'), they might continue with a strategy that beats my last move.
   - After ties, such as in rounds 271 and 272, they repeated the same move ('rock'). This suggests they might play the same move after a tie.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they play the move that would beat their opponent's last round move. This is evident from their choice of 'scissors' after I played 'paper' in round 273.
   - Additionally, after ties, they seem to repeat the same move, as seen in rounds 271 and 272.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move, and my last play was paper, I believe their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play scissors, I should play rock to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.6863100394744693, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to Moves:**
   - The opponent's move after each round seems to be influenced by the outcome of the previous round. For example, when the opponent wins, they often repeat the same move or choose a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but there are instances where they switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to align well with the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and choose a losing move after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as my last move, and considering that my last play was 'paper', I predict that their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as my last move, and since I last played scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat the same move or play a move that beats their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the same move or a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - **Wins**: The opponent often repeats the same move or plays a move that beats their last move.
   - **Losses**: The opponent frequently plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties**: The opponent's response is less consistent, but they sometimes play the same move or a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" closely matches the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, change to a winning move after a loss, and sometimes play a losing move after a tie.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            You last played: scissors

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.5756581271642958, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For example, after a loss, they often play the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a win, they sometimes repeat their move or play the move that would beat their last round's move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes plays the same move or the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior varies, but they sometimes play the move that would lose to their last round's move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to fit some of the observed behavior, but not consistently.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" also fits some of the observed behavior, especially after losses.

Upon reviewing the history, the opponent's behavior seems to align most closely with the strategy where they change their move based on the outcome of the previous round, particularly after losses and wins. The strategy that best fits this pattern is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In round 286, the opponent played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'rock', I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, which is to play the same move as my last move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and considering that I played 'scissors' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'scissors', my best move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and considering that I played 'scissors' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'scissors'.

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9916093746666725, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9916093746666725, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and considering that I played 'scissors' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round, I should play 'rock' to counter it and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, which suggests that they play the same move as their opponent's last move, and considering that my last play was 'rock', I predict that their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python

  'my_next_play': 'paper'
