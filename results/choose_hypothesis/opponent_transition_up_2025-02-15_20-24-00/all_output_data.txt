Top hypotheses: {}

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the given interaction history:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lost (opponent won)

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lost again (opponent won again)

Now, let's evaluate each strategy:

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move:** 
  - If this were true, after playing Rock in Round 0, the opponent would have played Paper in Round 1. But they played Rock again, so this strategy doesn't fit.

- **The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move:** 
  - If this were true, after playing Rock in Round 0, the opponent would have played Scissors in Round 1. But they played Rock again, so this strategy doesn't fit.

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move:**
  - After I played Scissors in Round 0, the opponent played Rock in Round 1, which beats Scissors. This strategy fits the observed behavior.

- **The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move:**
  - If this were true, after I played Scissors in Round 0, the opponent would have played Scissors in Round 1. But they played Rock, so this strategy doesn't fit.

- **After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move:**
  - The opponent won in Round 0 with Rock and played Rock again in Round 1. This strategy fits the observed behavior.

- **After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round:**
  - The opponent won in Round 0 with Rock and played Rock again in Round 1. This strategy doesn't fit because they didn't play Paper.

- **Complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and transition:**
  - This strategy is too complex to evaluate with only two rounds of data.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior so far is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after winning the last round, they are likely to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since they played 'rock' in the last round, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves in each round:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lose

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lose

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I lose

Now, let's evaluate the possible strategies:

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - Round 0: Opponent plays Rock.
  - Round 1: If they follow this strategy, they should play Paper (beats Rock), but they played Rock again.
  - Round 2: If they follow this strategy, they should play Scissors (beats Rock), which they did.

- **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - Round 0: Opponent plays Rock.
  - Round 1: If they follow this strategy, they should play Scissors (loses to Rock), but they played Rock.
  - Round 2: If they follow this strategy, they should play Paper (loses to Scissors), but they played Scissors.

- **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - Round 0: My play was Scissors, opponent played Rock (beats Scissors).
  - Round 1: My play was Scissors, opponent played Rock (beats Scissors).
  - Round 2: My play was Paper, opponent played Scissors (beats Paper).

- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - Round 0: My play was Scissors, opponent played Rock.
  - Round 1: My play was Scissors, opponent played Rock.
  - Round 2: My play was Paper, opponent played Scissors.

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - Round 0: Opponent wins, plays Rock.
  - Round 1: Opponent wins, plays Rock again.
  - Round 2: Opponent wins, plays Scissors (beats Paper).

- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - Round 0: Opponent wins, plays Rock.
  - Round 1: Opponent wins, plays Rock again.
  - Round 2: Opponent wins, plays Scissors (beats Paper).

- **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on previous outcomes and transitions.
  - This strategy is too complex to determine with only three rounds of data.

**Conclusion:**
The opponent's moves align with Strategy 3, where they play the move that would beat my last round's move. This strategy accurately predicts their moves in all three rounds.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move, and my last play was 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'scissors' to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lost

2. **Round 1**:
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lost

3. **Round 2**:
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I lost

4. **Round 3**:
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lost

Let's evaluate the potential strategies:

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move**: 
  - Round 0: Rock (no previous move to compare)
  - Round 1: Rock (beats Rock, not applicable)
  - Round 2: Scissors (beats Rock)
  - Round 3: Paper (beats Scissors)
  - This strategy does not fit as the opponent's moves do not consistently beat their previous move.

- **The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move**:
  - Round 0: Rock (no previous move to compare)
  - Round 1: Rock (loses to Rock, not applicable)
  - Round 2: Scissors (loses to Rock)
  - Round 3: Paper (loses to Scissors)
  - This strategy does not fit as the opponent's moves do not consistently lose to their previous move.

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move**:
  - Round 0: Rock (beats Scissors)
  - Round 1: Rock (beats Scissors)
  - Round 2: Scissors (beats Paper)
  - Round 3: Paper (beats Rock)
  - This strategy fits perfectly as the opponent's moves consistently beat my previous move.

- **The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move**:
  - Round 0: Rock (no previous move to compare)
  - Round 1: Rock (same as Scissors, not applicable)
  - Round 2: Scissors (same as Scissors)
  - Round 3: Paper (same as Paper)
  - This strategy does not fit as the opponent's moves do not consistently match my previous move.

- **After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move**:
  - This strategy does not fit as the opponent's moves do not follow this pattern.

- **After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round**:
  - This strategy does not fit as the opponent's moves do not follow this pattern.

- **Complex strategy based on previous outcomes and transitions**:
  - This strategy is too complex for the observed behavior.

The strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move, and my last play was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lost
   - Next move by opponent (Round 1): Rock

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lost
   - Next move by opponent (Round 2): Scissors

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I lost
   - Next move by opponent (Round 3): Paper

4. **Round 3:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lost
   - Next move by opponent (Round 4): Paper

5. **Round 4:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I won
   - Next move by opponent (Round 5): Unknown

**Analysis of Opponent's Strategy:**

- **Pattern Observation:**
  - After losing in Round 0, the opponent repeated their move (Rock) in Round 1.
  - After losing in Round 1, the opponent switched to a move that would beat their previous move (Scissors) in Round 2.
  - After losing in Round 2, the opponent switched to a move that would beat their previous move (Paper) in Round 3.
  - After losing in Round 3, the opponent repeated their move (Paper) in Round 4.

- **Behavior Based on Outcome:**
  - After a loss, the opponent sometimes repeats their move and sometimes switches to a move that would beat their previous move.

- **Strategy Evaluation:**
  - The opponent's behavior does not consistently match any single strategy perfectly. However, the closest match seems to be:
    - "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

  However, this strategy does not fully explain the opponent's behavior, as they sometimes repeat their move after a loss. The opponent's strategy might be a mix or a variant of the given strategies.

Given the analysis, the most fitting strategy based on the observed behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round, as rock would lose to paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

   - Opponent played the move that would beat their last move (Scissors -> Paper).

5. **Round 4**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Outcome: I won
   - Opponent repeated the same move (Paper).

6. **Round 5**: 
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Outcome: I won
   - Opponent played the move that would beat their last move (Paper -> Rock).

Now, let's evaluate the possible strategies:

- **Strategy 1**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - This strategy does not consistently explain the opponent's behavior, as they sometimes repeat their move.

- **Strategy 2**: The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This strategy does not fit the observed behavior.

- **Strategy 3**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - This strategy does not fit the observed behavior.

- **Strategy 4**: The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - This strategy does not fit the observed behavior.

- **Strategy 5**: After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This strategy fits the observed behavior:
    - After losing in rounds 0, 1, 2, and 3, the opponent played the move that would beat their last move.
    - After winning in round 4, the opponent repeated their move in round 5.

- **Strategy 6**: After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - This strategy does not fit the observed behavior.

- **Strategy 7**: Complex strategy based on multiple conditions.
  - This strategy is too complex given the observed behavior.

Based on the analysis, Strategy 5 best explains the opponent's behavior so far. Therefore, the selected strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played rock and I played paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best move to counter this would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Top hypotheses: {4: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.5541, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 5: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves based on the given history:

1. **Round 0**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next opponent move: Rock

2. **Round 1**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next opponent move: Scissors

3. **Round 2**: 
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next opponent move: Paper

4. **Round 3**: 
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next opponent move: Paper

5. **Round 4**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next opponent move: Rock

6. **Round 5**: 
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next opponent move: Scissors

7. **Round 6**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Next opponent move: ?

Let's analyze the patterns:

- **After a loss**: 
  - From round 0 to 1: Opponent played Rock after losing with Rock.
  - From round 1 to 2: Opponent played Scissors after losing with Rock.
  - From round 2 to 3: Opponent played Paper after losing with Scissors.
  - From round 3 to 4: Opponent played Paper after losing with Paper.

- **After a win**:
  - From round 4 to 5: Opponent played Rock after winning with Paper.
  - From round 5 to 6: Opponent played Scissors after winning with Rock.

- **After a tie**:
  - From round 6 to 7: Opponent played Scissors after tying with Scissors.

The opponent's moves seem to follow a pattern where they play the move that would beat their last round's move after a win, and they play the move that would lose to their last round's move after a tie. After a loss, the opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last round's move.

This behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Let's select this strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict that the opponent will play scissors again in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves based on the interaction history:

1. **Round 0 to 1:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' both times. 
   - My move: 'scissors' both times.
   - Result: Loss for me both times.
   - Opponent's move did not change after a win.

2. **Round 1 to 2:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'.
   - My move: 'scissors' then 'paper'.
   - Result: Loss for me both times.
   - Opponent changed from 'rock' to 'scissors' after a win.

3. **Round 2 to 3:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'paper'.
   - My move: 'paper' then 'rock'.
   - Result: Loss for me both times.
   - Opponent changed from 'scissors' to 'paper' after a win.

4. **Round 3 to 4:**
   - Opponent played 'paper' then 'paper'.
   - My move: 'rock' then 'scissors'.
   - Result: Loss for me, then win for me.
   - Opponent repeated 'paper' after a win.

5. **Round 4 to 5:**
   - Opponent played 'paper' then 'rock'.
   - My move: 'scissors' then 'paper'.
   - Result: Win for me both times.
   - Opponent changed from 'paper' to 'rock' after a loss.

6. **Round 5 to 6:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'.
   - My move: 'paper' then 'scissors'.
   - Result: Win for me, then tie.
   - Opponent changed from 'rock' to 'scissors' after a loss.

7. **Round 6 to 7:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'scissors'.
   - My move: 'scissors' then 'rock'.
   - Result: Tie, then win for me.
   - Opponent repeated 'scissors' after a tie.

**Analysis:**

- The opponent seems to change their move after a loss but sometimes repeats the move after a win or tie.
- The opponent's behavior after a win is inconsistent with the strategy of always repeating the move.
- The opponent's behavior after a loss is more consistent with changing to a move that would beat their last move.
- After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the move.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to align most closely with:

- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This strategy explains the observed behavior in most rounds.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost, so they are likely to play 'rock' next to beat their previous 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', I should play 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.7599, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of paper, I should play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lost
   - Next opponent play (Round 1): Rock
   - Observation: The opponent repeated their move after winning.

2. **Round 1**:
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Outcome: I lost
   - Next opponent play (Round 2): Scissors
   - Observation: The opponent switched to a move that would lose to their last move (Rock).

3. **Round 2**:
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I lost
   - Next opponent play (Round 3): Paper
   - Observation: The opponent switched to a move that would lose to their last move (Scissors).

4. **Round 3**:
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lost
   - Next opponent play (Round 4): Paper
   - Observation: The opponent repeated their move after winning.

5. **Round 4**:
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Outcome: I won
   - Next opponent play (Round 5): Rock
   - Observation: The opponent switched to a move that would beat their last move (Paper).

6. **Round 5**:
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Outcome: I won
   - Next opponent play (Round 6): Scissors
   - Observation: The opponent switched to a move that would beat their last move (Rock).

7. **Round 6**:
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Next opponent play (Round 7): Scissors
   - Observation: The opponent repeated their move after a tie.

8. **Round 7**:
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I won
   - Next opponent play (Round 8): Paper
   - Observation: The opponent switched to a move that would beat their last move (Scissors).

9. **Round 8**:
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Next opponent play (Round 9): Scissors
   - Observation: The opponent switched to a move that would beat their last move (Paper).

10. **Round 9**:
    - My play: Scissors
    - Opponent play: Scissors
    - Outcome: Tie
    - Next opponent play (Round 10): Unknown yet

**Analysis**:
- The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win.
- After a loss, the opponent switches to a move that would lose to their last move.
- After a tie, the opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat their last move.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to play rock next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0 to Round 1:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' both times.
   - My plays: 'scissors' both times.
   - Result: Loss for me both times.
   - Opponent's move stayed the same after a win.

2. **Round 1 to Round 2:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'.
   - My plays: 'scissors' then 'paper'.
   - Result: Loss for me, then loss for me.
   - Opponent changed from 'rock' to 'scissors' after a win.

3. **Round 2 to Round 3:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'paper'.
   - My plays: 'paper' then 'rock'.
   - Result: Loss for me, then loss for me.
   - Opponent changed from 'scissors' to 'paper' after a win.

4. **Round 3 to Round 4:**
   - Opponent played 'paper' then 'paper'.
   - My plays: 'rock' then 'scissors'.
   - Result: Loss for me, then win for me.
   - Opponent stayed with 'paper' after a win.

5. **Round 4 to Round 5:**
   - Opponent played 'paper' then 'rock'.
   - My plays: 'scissors' then 'paper'.
   - Result: Win for me, then win for me.
   - Opponent changed from 'paper' to 'rock' after a loss.

6. **Round 5 to Round 6:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'.
   - My plays: 'paper' then 'scissors'.
   - Result: Win for me, then tie.
   - Opponent changed from 'rock' to 'scissors' after a loss.

7. **Round 6 to Round 7:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'scissors'.
   - My plays: 'scissors' then 'rock'.
   - Result: Tie, then win for me.
   - Opponent stayed with 'scissors' after a tie.

8. **Round 7 to Round 8:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'paper'.
   - My plays: 'rock' then 'paper'.
   - Result: Win for me, then tie.
   - Opponent changed from 'scissors' to 'paper' after a loss.

9. **Round 8 to Round 9:**
   - Opponent played 'paper' then 'scissors'.
   - My plays: 'paper' then 'scissors'.
   - Result: Tie, then tie.
   - Opponent changed from 'paper' to 'scissors' after a tie.

10. **Round 9 to Round 10:**
    - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'rock'.
    - My plays: 'scissors' then 'paper'.
    - Result: Tie, then win for me.
    - Opponent changed from 'scissors' to 'rock' after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the opponent seems to change their move after a win or a tie, but not consistently in a predictable pattern. However, they often repeat their move after a win and change it after a loss or tie, which aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Thus, the most fitting strategy is:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played rock and lost to my paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves based on the given strategies and the interaction history:

1. **Round 0 to 1**: 
   - Opponent played 'rock' both times.
   - This could align with the strategy where the opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round move (since I played 'scissors' in round 0, which loses to 'rock').

2. **Round 1 to 2**:
   - Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'.
   - This could align with the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (since 'scissors' loses to 'rock').

3. **Round 2 to 3**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'paper'.
   - This could align with the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round move (since 'paper' beats 'rock').

4. **Round 3 to 4**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' then 'paper'.
   - This could align with the strategy where after a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

5. **Round 4 to 5**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' then 'rock'.
   - This could align with the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (since 'rock' loses to 'paper').

6. **Round 5 to 6**:
   - Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'.
   - This could align with the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (since 'scissors' loses to 'rock').

7. **Round 6 to 7**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'scissors'.
   - This could align with the strategy where after a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

8. **Round 7 to 8**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'paper'.
   - This could align with the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (since 'paper' loses to 'scissors').

9. **Round 8 to 9**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' then 'scissors'.
   - This could align with the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round move (since 'scissors' beats 'paper').

10. **Round 9 to 10**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'rock'.
    - This could align with the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round move (since 'rock' beats 'scissors').

11. **Round 10 to 11**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' then 'scissors'.
    - This could align with the strategy where the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (since 'scissors' loses to 'rock').

12. **Round 11 to 12**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' then 'scissors'.
    - This could align with the strategy where after a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to align most closely with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since their last move was 'scissors', they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0 to Round 1**: 
   - My play: Scissors, Opponent play: Rock (Opponent wins)
   - Opponent repeats Rock, which beats their last move (Rock).

2. **Round 1 to Round 2**:
   - My play: Scissors, Opponent play: Rock (Opponent wins)
   - Opponent plays Scissors, which loses to their last move (Rock).

3. **Round 2 to Round 3**:
   - My play: Paper, Opponent play: Scissors (Opponent wins)
   - Opponent plays Paper, which loses to their last move (Scissors).

4. **Round 3 to Round 4**:
   - My play: Rock, Opponent play: Paper (Opponent wins)
   - Opponent plays Paper again, which beats their last move (Paper).

5. **Round 4 to Round 5**:
   - My play: Scissors, Opponent play: Paper (I win)
   - Opponent plays Rock, which beats their last move (Paper).

6. **Round 5 to Round 6**:
   - My play: Paper, Opponent play: Rock (I win)
   - Opponent plays Scissors, which beats their last move (Rock).

7. **Round 6 to Round 7**:
   - My play: Scissors, Opponent play: Scissors (Tie)
   - Opponent plays Scissors again, which is the same as their last move (Scissors).

8. **Round 7 to Round 8**:
   - My play: Rock, Opponent play: Scissors (I win)
   - Opponent plays Paper, which beats their last move (Scissors).

9. **Round 8 to Round 9**:
   - My play: Paper, Opponent play: Paper (Tie)
   - Opponent plays Scissors, which beats their last move (Paper).

10. **Round 9 to Round 10**:
    - My play: Scissors, Opponent play: Scissors (Tie)
    - Opponent plays Rock, which beats their last move (Scissors).

11. **Round 10 to Round 11**:
    - My play: Paper, Opponent play: Rock (I win)
    - Opponent plays Scissors, which beats their last move (Rock).

12. **Round 11 to Round 12**:
    - My play: Scissors, Opponent play: Scissors (Tie)
    - Opponent plays Rock, which beats their last move (Scissors).

From this analysis, it appears that the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last round's move, especially after ties and losses. This suggests that the opponent is likely following a strategy where they play the move that would beat their last move after a tie or loss. However, after a win, they sometimes repeat the same move or play the move that would beat their last move.

The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', it is likely they will play 'rock' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.959646393, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves based on the interaction history:

1. **Round 0 to 1**: Opponent played 'rock' after playing 'rock' in the previous round. This could align with several strategies, but let's continue analyzing.

2. **Round 1 to 2**: Opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'rock'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

3. **Round 2 to 3**: Opponent played 'paper' after playing 'scissors'. This again suggests they might be playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

4. **Round 3 to 4**: Opponent played 'paper' after playing 'paper'. This could align with the strategy of playing the same move after a win.

5. **Round 4 to 5**: Opponent played 'rock' after playing 'paper'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

6. **Round 5 to 6**: Opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'rock'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

7. **Round 6 to 7**: Opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'scissors'. This could align with the strategy of playing the same move after a tie.

8. **Round 7 to 8**: Opponent played 'paper' after playing 'scissors'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

9. **Round 8 to 9**: Opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'paper'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

10. **Round 9 to 10**: Opponent played 'rock' after playing 'scissors'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

11. **Round 10 to 11**: Opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'rock'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

12. **Round 11 to 12**: Opponent played 'rock' after playing 'scissors'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

13. **Round 12 to 13**: Opponent played 'rock' after playing 'rock'. This could align with the strategy of playing the same move after a win.

14. **Round 13 to 14**: Opponent played 'rock' after playing 'rock'. This could align with the strategy of playing the same move after a win.

15. **Round 14 to 15**: Opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'rock'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

16. **Round 15 to 16**: Opponent played 'paper' after playing 'scissors'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

17. **Round 16 to 17**: Opponent played 'rock' after playing 'paper'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

18. **Round 17 to 18**: Opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'rock'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

19. **Round 18 to 19**: Opponent played 'paper' after playing 'scissors'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

20. **Round 19 to 20**: Opponent played 'rock' after playing 'paper'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

21. **Round 20 to 21**: Opponent played 'paper' after playing 'rock'. This could suggest they are playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

From this analysis, it seems the opponent is consistently playing the move that would beat their last round's move. This aligns with the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move, and they played 'paper' last round, I predict their next play will be 'scissors' to beat 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Round 0 to 1**: The opponent played 'rock' after playing 'rock' in the previous round. This could fit multiple strategies, but it doesn't provide enough information alone.

2. **Round 1 to 2**: The opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'rock'. This suggests they might be playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move, as 'scissors' beats 'paper'.

3. **Round 2 to 3**: The opponent played 'paper' after playing 'scissors'. This could indicate they are playing the move that would beat their last move, as 'paper' beats 'rock'.

4. **Round 3 to 4**: The opponent played 'paper' again after playing 'paper'. This might suggest they are playing the same move as their last move after a win.

5. **Round 4 to 5**: The opponent played 'rock' after playing 'paper'. This could indicate they are playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move, as 'rock' beats 'scissors'.

6. **Round 5 to 6**: The opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'rock'. This suggests they might be playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move, as 'scissors' beats 'paper'.

7. **Round 6 to 7**: The opponent played 'scissors' again after playing 'scissors'. This might suggest they are playing the same move as their last move after a tie.

8. **Round 7 to 8**: The opponent played 'paper' after playing 'scissors'. This could indicate they are playing the move that would beat their last move, as 'paper' beats 'rock'.

9. **Round 8 to 9**: The opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'paper'. This suggests they might be playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move, as 'scissors' beats 'paper'.

10. **Round 9 to 10**: The opponent played 'rock' after playing 'scissors'. This could indicate they are playing the move that would beat their last move, as 'rock' beats 'scissors'.

11. **Round 10 to 11**: The opponent played 'scissors' again after playing 'rock'. This suggests they might be playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move, as 'scissors' beats 'paper'.

12. **Round 11 to 12**: The opponent played 'rock' after playing 'scissors'. This could indicate they are playing the move that would beat their last move, as 'rock' beats 'scissors'.

13. **Round 12 to 13**: The opponent played 'rock' again after playing 'rock'. This might suggest they are playing the same move as their last move after a win.

14. **Round 13 to 14**: The opponent played 'rock' after playing 'rock'. This could indicate they are playing the same move as their last move after a loss.

15. **Round 14 to 15**: The opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'rock'. This suggests they might be playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move, as 'scissors' beats 'paper'.

16. **Round 15 to 16**: The opponent played 'paper' after playing 'scissors'. This could indicate they are playing the move that would beat their last move, as 'paper' beats 'rock'.

17. **Round 16 to 17**: The opponent played 'rock' after playing 'paper'. This suggests they might be playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move, as 'rock' beats 'scissors'.

18. **Round 17 to 18**: The opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'rock'. This could indicate they are playing the move that would beat their last move, as 'scissors' beats 'paper'.

19. **Round 18 to 19**: The opponent played 'paper' after playing 'scissors'. This suggests they might be playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move, as 'paper' beats 'rock'.

20. **Round 19 to 20**: The opponent played 'rock' after playing 'paper'. This could indicate they are playing the move that would beat their last move, as 'rock' beats 'scissors'.

21. **Round 20 to 21**: The opponent played 'paper' after playing 'rock'. This suggests they might be playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move, as 'paper' beats 'rock'.

22. **Round 21 to 22**: The opponent played 'paper' again after playing 'paper'. This might suggest they are playing the same move as their last move after a win.

Based on this analysis, the opponent seems to be following a strategy where they play the move that would beat their opponent's last move. This is consistent with the majority of their plays, where they choose the move that would beat what I played in the previous round.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move, and I played 'rock' in the last round, I predict their next play will be 'paper' to beat my 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Round 0 to 1**: 
   - Opponent played 'rock' both times, despite winning in round 0. This suggests they might not be changing moves after a win.

2. **Round 1 to 2**:
   - Opponent played 'rock' after winning with 'rock', then switched to 'scissors' after a win. This could suggest a pattern of switching to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Round 2 to 3**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after winning with 'scissors', then switched to 'paper' after a win. This suggests a possible pattern of switching to a move that would beat their last move.

4. **Round 3 to 4**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' after winning with 'paper', then switched to 'paper' again after a loss. This suggests they might repeat moves after a loss.

5. **Round 4 to 5**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' after losing with 'paper', then switched to 'rock' after a loss. This suggests they might switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.

6. **Round 5 to 6**:
   - Opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'rock', then switched to 'scissors' after a win. This suggests a pattern of switching to a move that would beat their last move after a win.

7. **Round 6 to 7**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after a tie, then switched to 'scissors' again. This suggests they might repeat moves after a tie.

8. **Round 7 to 8**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'scissors', then switched to 'paper' after a loss. This suggests they might switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.

9. **Round 8 to 9**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' after a tie, then switched to 'scissors' after a tie. This suggests they might switch to a move that would beat their last move after a tie.

10. **Round 9 to 10**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after a tie, then switched to 'rock' after a tie. This suggests they might switch to a move that would beat their last move after a tie.

11. **Round 10 to 11**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'rock', then switched to 'scissors' after a win. This suggests a pattern of switching to a move that would beat their last move after a win.

12. **Round 11 to 12**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after a tie, then switched to 'rock' after a tie. This suggests they might switch to a move that would beat their last move after a tie.

13. **Round 12 to 13**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' after winning with 'rock', then switched to 'rock' again after a loss. This suggests they might repeat moves after a loss.

14. **Round 13 to 14**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'rock', then switched to 'rock' again after a loss. This suggests they might repeat moves after a loss.

15. **Round 14 to 15**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'rock', then switched to 'scissors' after a loss. This suggests they might switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.

16. **Round 15 to 16**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'scissors', then switched to 'paper' after a loss. This suggests they might switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.

17. **Round 16 to 17**:
    - Opponent played 'paper' after losing with 'paper', then switched to 'rock' after a loss. This suggests they might switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.

18. **Round 17 to 18**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'rock', then switched to 'scissors' after a loss. This suggests they might switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.

19. **Round 18 to 19**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'scissors', then switched to 'paper' after a loss. This suggests they might switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.

20. **Round 19 to 20**:
    - Opponent played 'paper' after losing with 'paper', then switched to 'rock' after a loss. This suggests they might switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.

21. **Round 20 to 21**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'rock', then switched to 'paper' after a loss. This suggests they might switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.

22. **Round 21 to 22**:
    - Opponent played 'paper' after losing with 'paper', then switched to 'paper' again after a loss. This suggests they might repeat moves after a loss.

23. **Round 22 to 23**:
    - Opponent played 'paper' after losing with 'paper', then switched to 'paper' again after a loss. This suggests they might repeat moves after a loss.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to align most closely with the strategy where they switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and repeat moves after a tie or win. This suggests the following strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their last move, 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter this and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played 'rock', resulting in a tie. According to their strategy, they will play 'paper' next to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round, I should play 'scissors' to counter their 'paper' and secure a win.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent's moves: rock, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, paper, paper, rock, scissors.
   - My moves: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, rock, scissors, rock, scissors.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move when they win (e.g., rounds 0-1, 1-2, 12-13).
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their previous move (e.g., round 3-4, 21-22).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 6-7, 9-10).

3. **Strategy Matching:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well.
   - This strategy explains the behavior after wins and losses, and partially after ties.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and sometimes repeat or change after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played scissors, so the move that would lose to scissors is paper. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best move to counter this would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent has played 'rock' multiple times when I played 'scissors', resulting in my loss.
   - The opponent has also played 'scissors' when I played 'paper', resulting in my loss.
   - There are instances where the opponent played the same move as the previous round, especially after a win.

2. **Patterns in Response**:
   - The opponent seems to play the move that beats my last move quite often, especially after I lose. This suggests they might be adapting based on my previous move.
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, which aligns with the strategy of repeating a winning move.

3. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 0-1, 12-13).
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last move (e.g., rounds 3-4, 21-22).
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but there are instances where they play the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., rounds 6-7).

4. **Strategy Evaluation**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to partially fit, but not entirely.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" aligns more closely with the observed behavior.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior is best explained by the following strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's plays: rock, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock.
   - My plays: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, paper.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent's next move doesn't consistently follow a pattern of repeating the same move or switching to a move that beats or loses to their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent's next move sometimes changes to a move that beats their last move, but not consistently.
   - After a tie, the opponent's next move doesn't consistently follow a pattern of repeating the same move or switching to a move that beats or loses to their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - **The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move:** This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently play a move that beats their last move.
   - **The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move:** This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently play a move that loses to their last move.
   - **The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move:** This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently play a move that beats my last move.
   - **The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move:** This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently mirror my last move.
   - **After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move:** This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently follow this pattern.
   - **After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round:** This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently follow this pattern.
   - **Complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and transition:** This strategy seems plausible as it accounts for different transitions based on the outcome and previous transitions, which could explain the variability in the opponent's moves.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's moves, the last strategy seems to best fit the observed behavior, as it allows for different transitions based on both the outcome and the previous transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and won against the opponent's rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (rock vs. scissors), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, I should play scissors to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.36984038831361365, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent's moves are: rock, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper.
   - The outcomes are: loss, loss, loss, loss, win, win, tie, win, tie, tie, win, tie, loss, loss, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, loss, loss, win, tie, tie, loss, win, tie, win, win, win, win, win, tie.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to align with the observed behavior:
     - After wins, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move.
     - After losses, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move.
     - After ties, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie and they played 'paper', their likely play in the next round is 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves: rock, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors.
   - The opponent seems to have a pattern of repeating certain moves, especially after ties and losses.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win: The opponent often repeats the move that won.
   - After a loss: The opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie: The opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy where they:
     - After a win, play the same move as they did in the last round.
     - After a loss, play the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - After a tie, play the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This behavior matches the strategy described as: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Therefore, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played scissors in the last round and it was a tie, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent has played 'rock' against my 'scissors' multiple times, resulting in losses for me.
   - They have played 'scissors' against my 'paper' and 'paper' against my 'rock' in some instances, indicating they are not consistently using a single move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 0, 1, 2), the opponent tends to repeat the move that won them the round.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 4, 5, 7), they seem to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 6, 8, 9), they sometimes repeat the same move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

This strategy explains the observed behavior:
- After winning with 'rock' against my 'scissors', they repeated 'rock'.
- After losing with 'scissors' against my 'rock', they switched to 'rock'.
- After tying with 'scissors' against my 'scissors', they switched to 'rock', which would lose to 'scissors'.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves: rock, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, paper, paper, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper.
   - The opponent seems to frequently repeat moves or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome**:
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to fit some of the patterns observed.
   - However, the strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." seems to fit more accurately, as it accounts for the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior.

Given the observed patterns and the complexity of the opponent's responses, the most fitting strategy is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played paper, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie in which the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary and do not consistently follow a pattern of directly countering my last move. For example, when I played 'rock' in round 38, they also played 'rock', resulting in a tie.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie (e.g., round 38), the opponent played the same move ('rock') in the next round (round 39).
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., round 5 to 6, 'rock' to 'rock').
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 21 to 22, 'paper' to 'paper').

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."
   - This strategy explains their behavior after ties, wins, and losses, as observed in the history.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's behavior is best explained by the strategy where they repeat their move after a win, play a counter-move after a loss, and play a losing move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played rock, which resulted in a tie. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves are: rock, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock, rock, paper.
   - The opponent seems to frequently repeat moves, especially after ties or losses.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome**:
   - **Wins**: After winning, the opponent often repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses**: After losing, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties**: After ties, the opponent often repeats the same move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they often repeat their move after a win or tie, and switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss. This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since they won the last round with 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent's moves in response to my plays are varied, with no immediate obvious pattern.
   - The opponent's behavior seems to change based on the outcome (win, lose, tie).

   - **Ties:**
     - Round 6: Opponent played 'scissors' and tied. Next round, they played 'scissors' (same move).
     - Round 8: Opponent played 'paper' and tied. Next round, they played 'scissors' (move that loses to 'paper').
     - Round 9: Opponent played 'scissors' and tied. Next round, they played 'scissors' (same move).
     - Round 11: Opponent played 'scissors' and tied. Next round, they played 'scissors' (same move).
     - Round 24: Opponent played 'rock' and tied. Next round, they played 'scissors' (move that loses to 'rock').
     - Round 25: Opponent played 'scissors' and tied. Next round, they played 'scissors' (same move).
     - Round 28: Opponent played 'scissors' and tied. Next round, they played 'scissors' (same move).

     - Round 35: Opponent played 'scissors' and tied. Next round, they played 'scissors' (same move).
     - Round 37: Opponent played 'paper' and tied. Next round, they played 'scissors' (move that loses to 'paper').
     - Round 38: Opponent played 'rock' and tied. Next round, they played 'rock' (same move).

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to follow a pattern where they play the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss, play the same move after a win, and play the move that would lose to their last round's move after a tie.
   - This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Therefore, the opponent's strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, their next move is likely to be 'scissors' to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.5982436462912959, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions step by step:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent's moves are: rock, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, rock, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper, paper, rock, paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock.
   - My moves are: scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, scissors, paper, rock, rock, scissors, rock.

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent often repeats their previous move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - There are instances where the opponent's move would lose to their last move, but these are less frequent.

3. **Response to Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

4. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to match the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after wins, switch to a winning move after losses, and sometimes choose a losing move after ties.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the result was a tie as both played rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played rock, they will play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, I should play rock to counter it and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.803139386682735, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play the move that loses to 'paper', which is 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move is 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves in response to my plays and the outcomes of each round.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to frequently counter my previous move. For instance, when I played 'rock' in round 45, they played 'paper', which beats 'rock'. This pattern is consistent in several rounds.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats the move that won. For example, after winning with 'rock' in round 0, they played 'rock' again in round 1.
   - After a loss, they tend to switch to a move that would beat my last move. For instance, after losing with 'scissors' in round 4, they switched to 'rock' in round 5, which would beat 'scissors'.
   - After a tie, their behavior seems less predictable, but they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits these observations is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

This strategy aligns with the observed pattern of repeating winning moves, countering after losses, and sometimes switching to a losing move after ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.5124768096321781, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 46: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves in response to my plays seem to vary, but there might be a pattern based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - Let's look at the last few rounds to identify any patterns:
     - Round 45: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper', I lost.
     - Round 46: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper', I won.
     - Round 47: I need to predict the opponent's next move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome:**
   - After a win (Round 46), the opponent played the same move ('paper') as in the previous round (Round 45). This suggests that after a win, they might repeat their last move.
   - After a loss (Round 45), the opponent played 'paper', which would beat their previous move ('rock'). This suggests that after a loss, they might play the move that beats their last move.
   - After a tie, we need more data to determine their behavior, but it seems they might play the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that seems to fit this pattern is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.6587337667425247, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the given strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or choose moves that counter my previous plays.
   - There are also instances where the opponent's move seems to be a response to the outcome of the previous round.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The opponent's behavior after wins, losses, and ties seems to align with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Let's verify this with a few examples from the history:
- Round 3: I played rock, opponent played paper (opponent won). Next round, opponent played paper again (same move).
- Round 21: I played rock, opponent played paper (opponent won). Next round, opponent played paper again (same move).
- Round 24: Both played rock (tie). Next round, opponent played scissors (move that would lose to rock).

These examples suggest that the opponent's behavior is consistent with the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last move after a win, lose to their last move after a loss, and repeat their move after a tie.

Therefore, the most fitting strategy is:
```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing 'rock', the opponent is likely to play 'rock' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7611136367197673, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:

The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3180619773948802, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided interaction history and the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move as their previous round (e.g., rounds 8-9, 34-35, 48-49).
   - There are also instances where they switch to a move that would beat their previous move (e.g., round 2: scissors -> paper, round 12: rock -> paper).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After ties, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 8-9, 48-49).
   - After losses, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their previous move (e.g., round 12: rock -> paper).
   - After wins, they sometimes repeat the move (e.g., rounds 5-6, 15-16).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior after ties, losses, and wins suggests a mixed strategy. They sometimes repeat their move after a tie, switch to a move that would beat their previous move after a loss, and occasionally repeat their move after a win.
   - This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior is best explained by the following strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted paper play by the opponent, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.5226433841764161, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's move sequence doesn't consistently follow a pattern of directly countering my last move or repeating my last move. For example, in round 3, they played 'paper' against my 'rock', and in round 4, they played 'paper' again against my 'scissors', which doesn't directly counter my previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, as seen in rounds 4 and 5 where they played 'paper' after winning with 'paper'.
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their last move. For instance, in round 12, after losing with 'rock', they switched to 'rock' again in round 13, which doesn't fit a clear pattern.
   - After a tie, they sometimes play the move that would lose to their last move. For example, in round 6, after a tie with 'scissors', they played 'scissors' again in round 7.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that seems to fit most of these observations is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

This strategy accounts for the observed behavior where the opponent sometimes repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and plays a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to play rock next, as rock would lose to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays of 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors' don't show a consistent pattern of directly countering my last move. For example, after I played 'rock' in round 21, they played 'paper', which beats 'rock', but in round 24, they played 'rock' again after I played 'rock', resulting in a tie.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 12 to 13), the opponent repeated the move 'rock'.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 10 to 11), the opponent repeated the move 'scissors'.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 8 to 9), the opponent repeated the move 'scissors'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to repeat their last move regardless of the outcome (win, lose, or tie). This behavior aligns with the strategy where the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round after a win, loss, or tie.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is: "The opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round, and they played 'rock' in the last round, I believe their next play will be 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play 'rock', I should play 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to Moves:**
   - The opponent has played 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors' in various rounds, but there doesn't seem to be a consistent pattern of playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., rounds 5 to 6, 7 to 8) and sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., rounds 10 to 11).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., rounds 12 to 13) and sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., rounds 21 to 22).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., rounds 8 to 9) and sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., rounds 34 to 35).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to vary based on the outcome of the previous round (win, loss, or tie) and sometimes involves repeating the same move or switching to a move that would beat or lose to their last move.
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy accounts for the observed variability in the opponent's responses based on the outcome of the previous round.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has played scissors multiple times, resulting in ties when I also played scissors.
   - When I played rock against their scissors, I won.
   - When I played paper against their rock, I won.
   - When I played scissors against their paper, I won.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After ties (e.g., rounds 6, 9, 11, 25, 28, 35, 52, 55), the opponent often repeats the same move (scissors).
   - After losses (e.g., rounds 7, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 23, 27, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 40, 43, 44, 46, 49, 50, 53), the opponent sometimes changes their move.
   - After wins (e.g., rounds 12, 13, 21, 22, 26, 36, 39, 42, 45), the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or changes it.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after ties, which aligns with the strategy: "After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."
   - After losses, the opponent sometimes changes their move, which aligns with the strategy: "After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
   - After wins, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or changes it, which aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:
- After a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round.

This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where both played rock, the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played rock last, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (paper against scissors), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

1.

In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next to beat their last move, 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Patterns in Responses**: 
   - The opponent has played 'rock' after I played 'scissors' and they played 'rock' in the previous round (round 12 and 13). This suggests they might be repeating their move after a win.
   - In rounds 21 and 22, the opponent played 'paper' after I played 'rock', which they won against. They repeated 'paper' in the next round, suggesting they might repeat their move after a win.
   - In rounds 26 and 27, the opponent played 'rock' after I played 'scissors', which they won against. They switched to 'rock' again, suggesting they might repeat their move after a win.
   - In rounds 39 and 40, the opponent played 'paper' after I played 'rock', which they won against. They switched to 'paper' again, suggesting they might repeat their move after a win.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move (e.g., rounds 12-13, 21-22, 26-27, 39-40).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (e.g., round 11 to 12, round 25 to 26).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last round's move (e.g., round 45 to 46).

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.27609194103743584, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays of scissors, paper, and rock don't show a consistent pattern of directly countering my last move. For example, after I played scissors in round 60, they played rock, which beats scissors. However, in other rounds, their responses vary.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a loss (e.g., round 12, 13, 26, 36, 42), the opponent often plays a move that would beat their last move. For instance, after losing with rock to my paper in round 14, they played scissors in round 15.
   - After a win (e.g., round 14, 15, 16, 17, 18), the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 11, 24, 25, 28, 35), the opponent's response varies, sometimes repeating the same move or switching to a different one.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior after losses aligns with the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After wins, they sometimes repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After ties, their behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes repeat the same move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- **After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.**

This strategy accounts for the observed behavior after wins, losses, and ties, where the opponent often repeats moves after wins, switches to a winning move after losses, and varies after ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper' to secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.4932643587262051, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 61: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Patterns in Responses**: 
   - The opponent has played 'rock' multiple times when I played 'scissors', resulting in my loss.
   - The opponent has played 'rock' multiple times when I played 'paper', resulting in my win.
   - The opponent has played 'paper' when I played 'rock', resulting in my loss.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After I win with 'paper' against 'rock', the opponent sometimes repeats 'rock' or switches to 'scissors'.
   - After I lose with 'scissors' against 'rock', the opponent sometimes repeats 'rock'.
   - After ties, the opponent's next move varies.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently follow a simple pattern of repeating or switching based on the last round's outcome alone.
   - The opponent's behavior seems to depend on both the previous outcome and their previous move, suggesting a more complex strategy.

Given these observations, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This strategy accounts for the variability in their responses based on the combination of their last move and the outcome.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper'), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Pattern Analysis**: 
   - The opponent's moves in response to my moves do not consistently follow a pattern where they play the move that would beat or lose to their last move. 
   - The opponent's moves also do not consistently follow a pattern where they play the move that would beat or lose to my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent does not consistently play the same move or the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent does not consistently play the move that would beat their last move or lose to their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent does not consistently play the same move or the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be more complex and does not fit neatly into the simpler strategies.
   - The most complex strategy, which involves transitions based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition, seems to be a better fit. This strategy accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses after wins, losses, and ties, and considers their previous transitions.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the strategy that best explains their moves is the most complex one, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round, I should play paper to counter their move and win the round.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves are not consistently the same as my previous moves, nor are they consistently the move that would beat or lose to my previous move. This rules out simple strategies like "The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round move" or "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round move."

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move and sometimes changes it. This inconsistency suggests they might not be following a simple pattern like "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes changes their move to one that would beat their previous move, which aligns with the strategy: "After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move."
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last round's move, which aligns with the strategy: "After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to fit some of the observed behavior, but not all.
   - The more complex strategy involving transitions based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to fit better, as it accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses after wins, losses, and ties.

Given the analysis, the opponent's behavior is best explained by the complex strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the variability in their responses and aligns with the observed patterns.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played paper, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as the previous round, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play scissors, my best counter-move is to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the given interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where their response depends on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically, they tend to:
     - Repeat their move after a win or switch to a move that would beat their last move.
     - Switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.
     - Repeat their move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- **After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.**

This strategy accounts for the observed patterns in the opponent's responses based on the outcomes of previous rounds.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played scissors and lost. According to their strategy, they will play the move that would lose to scissors, which is paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.5843327725301618, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 65: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves after round 64: 
     - Round 64: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'rock' (I won).
     - Round 65: Opponent played 'paper', I played 'scissors' (I won).
   - The opponent's moves after round 63:
     - Round 63: Opponent played 'paper', I played 'paper' (tie).
     - Round 64: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'rock' (I won).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win (round 64), the opponent played 'paper' in round 65, which would lose to their previous move 'scissors'. 
   - After a tie (round 63), the opponent played 'scissors' in round 64, which would beat their previous move 'paper'.

3. **Strategy Matching:**
   - The opponent's behavior after a win in round 64 matches the strategy where they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - The opponent's behavior after a tie in round 63 matches the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move."

This aligns with the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

Thus, the best-fitting strategy is:
```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move, and they played 'paper' last round, I predict their next play will be 'rock' (since rock loses to paper).

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7090329407711132, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' next, as it would lose to their last move 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. According to their strategy, they should play 'paper' next, as it would lose to 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the same move after a win, a move that would lose to their last move after a loss, and a move that would beat their last move after a tie. Since I won the last round with scissors against their paper, they are likely to play paper again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Identify Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's plays after each round can be analyzed to see if they follow a consistent pattern.
   - For instance, if the opponent consistently plays a move that would beat their previous move, that would suggest a specific strategy.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - We need to check if the opponent's behavior changes after wins, losses, or ties.
   - For example, if after a win, they repeat their move, or if after a loss, they switch to a move that would beat their previous move.

3. **Match Observed Moves to Strategies:**
   - We compare the opponent's moves to the possible strategies to see which one fits best.

**Analysis of Recent Rounds:**

- **Round 68:** Opponent played 'paper', I played 'scissors' (I won).
- **Round 69:** Opponent played 'rock', I played 'scissors' (I lost).

From the above rounds:
- After losing in round 68, the opponent played 'rock' in round 69, which beats their previous move 'paper'. This suggests a pattern where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

**Checking Against Strategies:**

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - This fits the behavior observed in round 69, where the opponent played 'rock' after playing 'paper' in round 68.

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This also fits the behavior observed, as after losing in round 68, they played 'rock' in round 69, which beats 'paper'.

Given the consistent pattern of playing the move that would beat their last move after a loss, Strategy 5 seems to be the best fit.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played scissors and lost to the opponent's rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Identifying Patterns:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays are crucial to identifying their strategy.
   - We need to check if they are consistently playing a move that beats, loses to, or ties with their previous move or my previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - We should examine if the opponent changes their behavior based on whether they won, lost, or tied the previous round.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This would mean if they played 'rock' last, they would play 'paper' next.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This would mean if they played 'rock' last, they would play 'scissors' next.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move.
     - This would mean if I played 'rock' last, they would play 'paper' next.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as my last round's move.
     - This would mean if I played 'rock' last, they would play 'rock' next.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round.
   - **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made.

4. **Testing Strategies:**
   - Let's test these strategies against the interaction history to see which one fits best.

   - **Round 69 to 70:**
     - Round 69: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'scissors', opponent won.
     - Round 70: Opponent played 'rock', I played 'paper', opponent lost.
     - If the opponent won in round 69, according to Strategy 5, they should play the same move ('rock') in round 70, which they did.
     - If the opponent lost in round 70, according to Strategy 5, they should play the move that beats their last move ('rock'), which would be 'paper' in round 71.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Strategy 5 seems to fit the observed behavior: after a win, the opponent repeats their move; after a loss, they play the move that beats their last move; after a tie, they play the move that loses to their last move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent has shown a tendency to play the same move consecutively, especially when it results in a tie. Given that the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, it is likely that the opponent will play scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7599680164487806, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played 'rock', resulting in a tie. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter this and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8319776115141464, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost. According to their strategy, they should play the move that would lose to paper, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it effectively.

In the last round, I played scissors and won against their paper. According to their strategy, after a loss, they will play the move that would lose to their last round's move, which is paper. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter move is paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9952537833974884, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played rock and I played paper), they will play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' next, as it would lose to 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' next, as it would lose to 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best move to counter this would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' next, as it would lose to 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it and secure a win.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently beat, lose to, or match their previous moves or my previous moves. This rules out the first four strategies.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome:**
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their move or choose a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior in some cases.
   - However, the more complex strategy involving transitions based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to capture the nuanced behavior observed in the history. This strategy accounts for different responses based on whether the opponent's last move was a win, loss, or tie, and how they transitioned from the round before that.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the most fitting strategy is the complex one that considers both the previous outcome and transition:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and the opponent played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the provided strategies.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves are not explicitly listed, but we can infer them from the outcomes and our moves.
   - We have a consistent pattern of winning with paper against rock, scissors against paper, and rock against scissors, indicating the opponent frequently plays rock, paper, or scissors in a predictable sequence.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent's next move seems to be the same move they played in the last round. For example, if they played rock and lost, they might switch to paper.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move. For example, if they lost with rock, they might switch to paper.
   - After a tie, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would lose to their last move. For example, if they tied with rock, they might switch to scissors.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains the observed behavior, where the opponent repeats their move after a win, adapts to beat their previous move after a loss, and switches to a move that would lose to their previous move after a tie.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7941678100639143, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the same move after a win, a losing move after a loss, and a winning move after a tie. In the last round, I played scissors and won against their paper. According to their strategy, after a loss, they will play the move that would lose to their last round's move, which was paper. Therefore, their next play is likely to be rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round since 'scissors' would lose to 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be to play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round, as it would lose to 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their move.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.36540578383744204, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 72: {'value': 0.30608600879821196, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the potential strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves often result in ties when I play scissors, suggesting they might be mirroring my moves or following a pattern that leads to frequent ties with scissors.
   - When I play paper, the opponent often plays rock, which I beat. This suggests they might be playing a move that loses to my previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After ties, the opponent seems to play the same move again, as seen in rounds 55, 59, 62, 71, 94, 96, and 102 where both played scissors.
   - After losses, the opponent doesn't seem to consistently play the move that would beat their last move, as they often repeat the move that lost.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well. This is because when I play paper, they often play rock, which loses to paper. When I play scissors, they often play scissors, resulting in a tie, which could be seen as a move that would lose to their last move if they are mirroring.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move, and their last move was scissors, I believe their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play paper, I should play scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.5557840486862095, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's last move was 'rock' after I played 'scissors' and lost.
   - Before that, the opponent played 'scissors' when I played 'scissors', resulting in a tie.
   - The opponent played 'scissors' when I played 'rock', resulting in a loss for them.
   - The opponent played 'scissors' when I played 'scissors', resulting in a tie.
   - The opponent played 'rock' when I played 'scissors', resulting in a win for them.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win (round 103), the opponent played 'rock', which beats my last move 'scissors'.
   - After a tie (round 102), the opponent played 'rock', which beats my last move 'scissors'.
   - After a loss (round 101), the opponent played 'scissors', which would lose to my last move 'rock'.
   - After a tie (round 100), the opponent played 'scissors', which would lose to my last move 'rock'.
   - After a win (round 99), the opponent played 'scissors', which would lose to my last move 'paper'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a win.
   - After a loss, they seem to play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - After a tie, they seem to play the move that would lose to their last round's move.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' next, as it would beat their last move 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }
            ```

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.6890488340803467, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 72: {'value': 0.23998214431112386, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it against the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves in the last few rounds were:
     - Round 103: Opponent played 'rock' after I played 'scissors' (opponent won).
     - Round 104: Opponent played 'rock' again after I played 'scissors' (opponent won again).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning in round 103 with 'rock', the opponent repeated 'rock' in round 104.
   - This suggests that after a win, the opponent might repeat their previous move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - Let's evaluate the strategies:
     - **Strategy 1:** Plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
       - This doesn't match as the opponent repeated 'rock' after winning with 'rock'.
     - **Strategy 2:** Plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
       - This doesn't match as the opponent repeated 'rock' after winning with 'rock'.
     - **Strategy 3:** Plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
       - This doesn't match as the opponent repeated 'rock' instead of playing 'paper' to beat my 'scissors'.
     - **Strategy 4:** Plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
       - This doesn't match as the opponent didn't play 'scissors' after I played 'scissors'.
     - **Strategy 5:** After a win, plays the same move; after a loss, plays the move that would beat their last round's move; after a tie, plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
       - This matches the observed behavior: after winning with 'rock', the opponent repeated 'rock'.
     - **Strategy 6:** After a win, plays the move that would beat their last round's move; after a loss, plays the move that would lose to their last round's move; after a tie, plays the same move.
       - This doesn't match as the opponent didn't play 'paper' after winning with 'rock'.
     - **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on previous outcomes and transitions.
       - This is too complex for the observed behavior, which seems simpler.

Based on the analysis, Strategy 5 best explains the opponent's behavior so far. The opponent repeats their move after a win, which aligns with the observed pattern.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they won with 'rock'. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7823341838562426, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' next, as it would lose to their last move, 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play the move that loses to 'scissors', which is 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move is 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9477384375438839, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played scissors last, they would play paper next, as paper loses to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play the move that loses to scissors, which is paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their move.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play the move that loses to 'scissors', which is 'paper'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round where they played scissors, they are likely to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played scissors, they might play paper next, as paper loses to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9992766327044719, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played scissors and lost to my rock), they are likely to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played scissors last, they will likely play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' next, as it would lose to their last move 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'paper' next, as it would lose to 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played scissors, they will likely play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9999965657692702, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round, as 'paper' would lose to 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round where they played scissors, they are likely to play the move that would lose to their last round's move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.399999902991482, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - From rounds 97 to 145, the opponent consistently played moves that would lose to my previous move. For example, when I played 'paper', they played 'rock'; when I played 'rock', they played 'scissors'; and when I played 'scissors', they played 'paper'. This pattern was consistent and resulted in my winning streak.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not seem to change based on the outcome (win, loss, or tie). They consistently played the move that would lose to my previous move, regardless of whether they won or lost the previous round.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move." This strategy explains why they consistently played the losing move to my previous play.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move, and they played 'paper' in the last round, I predict their next move will be 'rock', as 'rock' would lose to 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {147: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be consistently beaten by my moves, indicating a predictable pattern.
   - For example, when I played 'paper', they played 'rock', which I beat.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - The opponent's moves do not seem to change significantly after wins, losses, or ties. They continue to play moves that I can predictably beat.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's moves appear to be consistently one step behind, suggesting they might be playing the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - This aligns with the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Given the consistent pattern of the opponent playing moves that I can beat, the strategy that best explains their behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would lose to their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'scissors' (since scissors would lose to rock).

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves have been consistently beaten by my plays, especially in the recent rounds. This suggests a lack of adaptation or a predictable pattern.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - The opponent has lost many rounds in a row, indicating they might not be adapting based on the outcome (win, loss, tie).

3. **Comparison with Strategies:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit, as they would have played moves that beat their previous ones, but they consistently lose.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit either, as they would have played moves that lose to their previous ones, but they consistently lose to my plays.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit, as they would have won more rounds.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit, as they would have tied more often.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move; after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move; after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit, as they don't seem to adapt after losses.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move; after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move; after a tie, they play the same move.
     - This doesn't fit, as they don't adapt after losses.
   - **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and transition.
     - This is complex and doesn't seem to fit the simplicity of their losing pattern.

Given the consistent losses and lack of adaptation, the opponent's behavior most closely aligns with Strategy 2: "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move." This would explain why they consistently lose, as they are effectively playing into my winning moves.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would lose to their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'scissors', their next play is likely to be 'paper' (since paper would lose to scissors).

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be consistently beaten by my moves, indicating a potential pattern.
   - For example, when I played 'scissors' in round 149, the opponent played 'paper', which I beat.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not seem to change drastically based on the outcome (win, loss, or tie).
   - They have been consistently losing, which suggests they might not be adapting based on the outcome.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The opponent's moves often align with the move that would lose to their last round's move. For instance, if they played 'rock' in one round, they might play 'scissors' in the next, which would lose to 'rock'.
   - This pattern fits the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would lose to their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'paper', their next play is likely to be 'rock' (since rock loses to paper).

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {147: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.15990000000000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 148: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.05700000000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's last move was 'scissors', which beat my 'paper'. In the previous round (round 149), I played 'scissors', and the opponent played 'paper', which I won.
   - In round 148, I played 'rock', and the opponent played 'scissors', which I won.
   - In round 147, I played 'paper', and the opponent played 'rock', which I won.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win in round 149, the opponent switched from 'paper' to 'scissors' in round 150, which beat my 'paper'.
   - After a loss in round 148, the opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'paper' in round 149, which lost to my 'scissors'.
   - After a win in round 147, the opponent switched from 'rock' to 'scissors' in round 148, which lost to my 'rock'.

3. **Strategy Evaluation**:
   - The opponent seems to switch moves after a win or a loss, which suggests they might not be sticking to a single move.
   - The opponent's move in round 150 ('scissors') beat my move in round 149 ('scissors'), suggesting they might be playing the move that would beat my last round's move.
   - However, after a loss in round 148, the opponent played a move ('paper') that lost to my move ('scissors') in round 149.

Given these observations, the opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the opponent's behavior in the recent rounds, where they switched moves after wins and losses in a manner consistent with this pattern.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3350979836957784, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the given strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent played 'scissors' in the last two rounds, and both times I played 'paper', resulting in a loss for me.
   - Before these losses, the opponent played 'paper' when I played 'scissors', resulting in a win for me.
   - The opponent's move seems to be reactive to my previous move, but not consistently in a straightforward manner.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After the opponent's win in round 150 (opponent played 'scissors', I played 'paper'), they repeated the same move 'scissors' in round 151.
   - After a win, the opponent repeated their move.
   - After a tie in round 146 (both played 'paper'), the opponent switched to 'rock' in round 147, which I beat with 'paper'.
   - After a loss in round 147 (opponent played 'rock', I played 'paper'), the opponent switched to 'scissors' in round 148, which I beat with 'rock'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win.
   - After a tie, they switch to a move that would lose to their previous move.
   - After a loss, they switch to a move that would beat their previous move.

The strategy that best fits this pattern is:
- "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

This strategy aligns with the observed behavior: repeating moves after wins, switching to a winning move after losses, and switching to a losing move after ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after winning the last two rounds with scissors, they are likely to play scissors again in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.5345685885870449, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 152: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 103 to 152, the opponent's moves have been mostly predictable, with a few exceptions.
   - The opponent tends to play a move that would lose to their previous move or play the same move as my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 150), the opponent played 'scissors' again in round 151, which is the same move as their last round.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 152), the opponent played 'scissors' again, which would lose to their last move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 146), the opponent played 'rock' in round 147, which would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy where they play the move that would lose to their last round's move after a loss, and play the same move after a win.
   - This behavior is consistent with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat their previous move 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.6741980120109314, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 104 to 145, the opponent consistently played 'rock' when I played 'scissors', 'scissors' when I played 'paper', and 'paper' when I played 'rock'. This suggests a pattern where the opponent plays the move that would beat my last move.
   - However, in round 146, the opponent played 'paper' when I played 'paper', resulting in a tie. In round 147, they played 'rock', which would beat their previous 'paper' move, suggesting a deviation from the previous pattern.

2. **Behavior Changes Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 104), the opponent continued to play the move that would beat my last move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 146), the opponent played 'rock' in round 147, which would beat their last move 'paper'.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 150), the opponent played 'scissors' again in round 151, which would beat their previous 'scissors' move, suggesting they are trying to beat their own last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last move after a tie or loss, and continue with the same move after a win. This is consistent with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both played paper, so the opponent is likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play the move that loses to 'paper', which is 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'rock', I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9868527146168704, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.39549048111358653, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the given history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 116 to 145, the opponent consistently played moves that I could beat, indicating a predictable pattern. However, from round 146 onwards, there are ties and losses for me, suggesting a change in their strategy or adaptation to my moves.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie (round 146), the opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper' in round 147, which I won. This suggests they might play a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.
   - After a loss (round 147), the opponent played 'scissors' against my 'rock' in round 148, which I won. This suggests they might play a move that would beat their last move after a loss.
   - After a win (round 150), the opponent played 'scissors' again in round 151, which I lost. This suggests they might play the same move after a win.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy fits the observed behavior, as the opponent tends to repeat their move after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and choose a losing move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, the opponent is likely to play rock next, as rock loses to paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.5768433367795106, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 117 to 145, the opponent consistently lost, indicating they might not have been adapting effectively to my moves.
   - Starting from round 146, the opponent's behavior seems to change, as they managed to tie or win more frequently.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 150 and 151), the opponent played 'scissors' again, suggesting they might repeat their winning move.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 152), the opponent switched to 'paper', which would beat their previous move 'scissors'.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 153), the opponent played 'scissors', which would beat 'paper', indicating a possible switch to a winning move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and possibly switch to a losing move after a tie.
   - This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since they won the last round with scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play the move that loses to scissors, which is paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their move.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their move and secure a win.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' next, as it loses to 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' next, as it would lose to 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round, my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9941429670933484, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they should play 'rock' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3959000769653439, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and evaluate which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent seems to frequently play moves that beat my previous move, especially after I win. For instance, when I played 'rock' and won, they often responded with 'paper' (which beats 'rock') in the next round.
   - When I played 'paper' and lost, they often continued with 'scissors', which suggests they might be sticking with a winning move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **After Wins:** The opponent seems to repeat their winning move or play the move that beats their last move. For example, after they win with 'scissors' against my 'paper', they often play 'scissors' again or switch to 'rock'.
   - **After Losses:** They tend to switch to a move that would beat their last move. For example, after losing with 'rock', they might switch to 'paper'.
   - **After Ties:** They seem to switch to a move that would lose to their last move or repeat the same move.

3. **Strategy Evaluation:**
   - The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains the observed behavior: repeating winning moves, switching to counter their own losing moves, and changing moves after ties to a less aggressive option.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat a pattern of losing to my move, especially when I play 'rock' against their 'scissors'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - When the opponent loses (e.g., when I play 'rock' and they play 'scissors'), they don't consistently switch to a move that would beat my last move. Instead, they sometimes repeat the losing move.
   - After a tie, such as when both play 'paper', the opponent doesn't consistently switch to a move that would lose to their last move.
   - After a win, the opponent doesn't consistently play the same move or switch to a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior doesn't strictly follow a simple pattern like playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move.
   - The strategy that involves complex transitions based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to fit better, as it accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the one where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This strategy accounts for the observed variability and lack of a simple pattern in their moves.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'rock' and the opponent played 'scissors', resulting in my win. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper' to secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played paper, resulting in a tie. According to their strategy, they are likely to play scissors next, as scissors beats paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round, I should play rock to counter this, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move is to play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play the move that loses to 'rock', which is 'scissors'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best move to counter this would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play the move that would lose to 'rock', which is 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3993113928295836, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **After a Loss:** The opponent often plays the move that would beat their last round's move. For example, in round 198, the opponent played 'paper' after losing with 'scissors' in round 197.
   - **After a Win:** The opponent sometimes repeats the same move or plays the move that would beat their last round's move. For example, in round 197, the opponent played 'scissors' after winning with 'scissors' in round 196.
   - **After a Tie:** The opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. For example, in round 181, after a tie with 'paper', the opponent played 'scissors' in round 182.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

Based on the analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and won. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors next, as it beats paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses**:
   - From rounds 150 to 199, the opponent's moves are as follows:
     - They frequently play 'scissors' against 'paper', 'rock' against 'scissors', and 'paper' against 'rock'.
     - There are instances where they repeat the same move, especially after a win.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats the move that won.
   - After a loss, they tend to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, they sometimes repeat the same move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat winning moves, switch to a winning move after a loss, and sometimes switch to a losing move after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since they won the last round with 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9505307102385054, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' next, as it would lose to 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the potential strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent played 'paper' in rounds 198, 199, and 208 when I played 'rock', resulting in losses for me. This suggests a pattern where the opponent anticipates my 'rock' play and counters it with 'paper'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - In round 198, the opponent played 'paper' after losing in round 197. 
   - In round 199, the opponent played 'paper' again after winning in round 198.
   - In round 208, the opponent played 'paper' after winning in round 207.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent seems to play 'paper' consistently after both wins and losses, which suggests they might be sticking to a strategy that doesn't change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - The opponent's move in round 208 (playing 'paper' after winning with 'rock' in round 207) suggests they might not be following a simple win-lose-tie strategy.

Given the observed behavior, the opponent's strategy seems to align most closely with a pattern where they play the move that would beat their opponent's last round move. This is because they consistently played 'paper' after I played 'rock', which is the move that beats 'rock'.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move, and I played 'rock' in the last round, I predict that their next play will be 'paper' to beat my 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's plays seem to be influenced by my last move. For example, when I played 'scissors' in round 209 and won, the opponent played 'paper' which was beaten by my 'scissors'. This suggests that they might be trying to counter my previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to play a move that would beat their last move. For example, in round 198, they played 'paper' after losing with 'scissors' in round 197, which would beat 'rock' (my move in round 197).
   - After a loss, they seem to play a move that would lose to their last move. For instance, in round 199, they played 'paper' again after losing with 'paper' in round 198.
   - After a tie, they seem to play the same move as they did in the last round. For example, in round 165, they played 'paper' again after tying with 'paper' in round 164.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits these observations is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy accurately predicts the opponent's behavior based on the observed patterns in the interaction history.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round, as rock would lose to paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be influenced by my previous moves. For instance, when I played 'rock' and won, the opponent played 'scissors' in the next round, which is a losing move against 'rock'.
   - When I played 'paper' and won, the opponent played 'rock' in the next round, which is a losing move against 'paper'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win for me, the opponent tends to play a move that would lose to my last move. For example, after I won with 'paper' against 'rock', the opponent played 'rock' again.
   - After a loss for me, the opponent's move seems to be the same as their previous move. For example, when I lost with 'rock' against 'paper', the opponent played 'paper' again.
   - After a tie, the opponent's move seems to change to a move that would lose to my last move. For example, after a tie with 'paper', the opponent played 'rock'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy best explains the opponent's behavior as it accounts for the observed patterns in their responses to my moves and their changes based on the outcomes of the rounds.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'paper' and won against their 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper' to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Identifying Patterns:**
   - From rounds 162 to 211, the opponent's moves and the outcomes are given.
   - We need to check if the opponent's move in each round aligns with any of the strategies described.

2. **Analyzing Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent wins when they play a move that beats my move.
   - **Losses:** The opponent loses when they play a move that is beaten by my move.
   - **Ties:** The opponent ties when they play the same move as I do.

3. **Checking Strategies:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This strategy doesn't align well, as it would mean the opponent consistently wins, which is not the case.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This strategy also doesn't align well, as it would mean the opponent consistently loses, which is not the case.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This strategy doesn't fit well, as it would mean the opponent consistently wins, which is not the case.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This strategy doesn't fit well, as the opponent doesn't consistently tie.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move. After a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This strategy doesn't fit well, as the opponent's moves don't consistently follow this pattern.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, they play the same move.
     - This strategy doesn't fit well, as the opponent's moves don't consistently follow this pattern.
   - **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
     - This strategy is complex and considers multiple factors, which might explain the variability in the opponent's moves.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given the variability in the opponent's moves and the lack of a consistent pattern that fits the simpler strategies, the most likely strategy is the complex one (Strategy 7), which accounts for both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter-move is to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9176457, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie (e.g., round 216), the opponent played the same move again (rock). This suggests a pattern where they might play the same move after a tie.
   - After losses, there are instances where the opponent switches to a move that would beat their previous move (e.g., round 198 to 199, where they lost with paper and played paper again, which would lose to rock).
   - After wins, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to fit the observed behavior:
     - After ties, the opponent repeats the same move.
     - After losses, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move.
     - After wins, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to play rock again.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the given strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat their previous move or choose a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Comparing with Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to partially fit, but not consistently.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" also fits some instances.
   - The complex strategy involving transitions based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to fit the observed behavior more accurately, as it accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the last strategy, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition, seems to best explain the observed moves.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - When I played 'rock' in round 218, the opponent played 'scissors', which I beat. 
   - In round 217, I played 'paper', and the opponent also played 'paper', resulting in a tie.
   - In round 216, I played 'rock', and the opponent played 'rock', resulting in a tie.
   - In round 215, I played 'paper', and the opponent played 'rock', which I beat.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a loss (round 215), the opponent played 'rock' again in round 216, which resulted in a tie.
   - After a tie (round 216), the opponent played 'paper' in round 217, which resulted in another tie.
   - After a tie (round 217), the opponent played 'scissors' in round 218, which I beat with 'rock'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to change based on the outcome of the previous round. 
   - After a loss, they repeated the same move (round 215 to 216).
   - After a tie, they switched to a move that would lose to their last move (round 216 to 217).
   - After another tie, they switched to a move that would beat their last move (round 217 to 218).

Based on these observations, the opponent's strategy seems to align with the following description:

- **After a win**, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- **After a loss**, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
- **After a tie**, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

This strategy best explains the opponent's behavior in the recent rounds.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors against my rock), they will play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played scissors last, they will play paper next, as paper loses to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.77442673257, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'scissors' last, I predict their next play will be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.92262836927151, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played scissors last, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to beat my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9734615306601279, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played scissors last, I predict their next play will be rock to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's plays after each round are as follows:
     - Round 227: Opponent played 'rock' after a tie.
     - Round 226: Opponent played 'rock' after a loss.
     - Round 225: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 224: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 223: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 222: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 221: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 220: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 219: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 218: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 217: Opponent played 'rock' after a tie.
     - Round 216: Opponent played 'rock' after a tie.
     - Round 215: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 214: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 213: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 212: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 211: Opponent played 'rock' after a tie.
     - Round 210: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 209: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 208: Opponent played 'rock' after a loss.
     - Round 207: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 206: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 205: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 204: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 203: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 202: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 201: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 200: Opponent played 'rock' after a win.
     - Round 199: Opponent played 'rock' after a loss.
     - Round 198: Opponent played 'rock' after a loss.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - The opponent seems to play 'rock' consistently, regardless of the outcome of the previous round (win, loss, or tie).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. They consistently play 'rock', which suggests a very simple strategy that does not depend on the previous round's outcome or the opponent's move.

Given this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be playing 'rock' consistently, regardless of the previous round's outcome or moves. This does not fit any of the complex strategies provided, but it aligns with a simple strategy of always playing 'rock'.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent consistently plays rock, regardless of the previous round\'s outcome or moves.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is consistently playing rock, I believe their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the given history and the potential strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently beat, lose to, or match my last move. This rules out the strategies where they play the move that would beat or lose to my last move or play the same move as my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move and sometimes changes it. This inconsistency suggests they are not following a simple pattern of repeating or changing their move after a win.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes changes their move to one that would beat their last move, but this is not consistent enough to confirm a simple pattern.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move and sometimes changes it. This inconsistency suggests they are not following a simple pattern of repeating or changing their move after a tie.

3. **Most Accurate Strategy:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be influenced by both the outcome of the previous round and their previous transition. This suggests a more complex strategy that considers both the result and the transition type.
   - The strategy described in the last option fits this pattern, as it accounts for the opponent's move two rounds ago, the outcome, and the transition type.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the complex one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. Therefore, the selected strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as the previous round, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best explains their behavior.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves are not consistent with simply playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move, nor are they consistently playing the move that would beat or match my last move.
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round (win, loss, or tie).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 181: tie with paper, round 182: opponent plays scissors, which beats paper).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 198: opponent plays paper after losing with scissors).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 211: tie with scissors, round 212: opponent plays rock, which loses to scissors).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy that changes based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely the one that changes based on the outcome of the previous round, specifically:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would lose to their last round's move, which is rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9495164970378773, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played 'rock' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat my 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best move to counter this would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9826841584839919, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'rock' last, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat my 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

Top hypotheses: {209: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.38787891093879434, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - From rounds 189 to 237, the opponent's moves are not explicitly listed, but we can infer them based on the outcomes.
   - The opponent seems to have a pattern where they often play a move that results in a win for me, suggesting they might be playing a move that loses to my previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win for me (e.g., rounds 189, 190, 191), the opponent's move seems to change in a way that allows me to win again, indicating they might not be sticking to a single move.
   - After a tie (e.g., rounds 211, 216, 227), the opponent's next move doesn't consistently lead to a win for them, suggesting they might not be adapting based on ties.
   - After a loss for me (e.g., rounds 198, 199, 208), the opponent's move doesn't consistently lead to another win for them, suggesting they might not be adapting based on their wins.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's moves don't seem to be consistently beating their previous move or my previous move.
   - The opponent's moves don't seem to be consistently losing to their previous move or my previous move.
   - The opponent's moves don't seem to be consistently the same as their previous move or my previous move.

Given these observations, the opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy where they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. This would explain why I often win, as they are playing a move that is countered by my previous move.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is: "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would lose to their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'scissors', I predict their next play will be 'rock', as it would lose to 'scissors'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 240, {'round': 239, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 190, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 191, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 192, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 193, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 194, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 195, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 196, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 197, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 198, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 199, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 200, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 201, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 202, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 203, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 204, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 205, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 206, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 207, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 208, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 209, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 210, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 211, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 212, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 213, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 214, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 215, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 216, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 217, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 218, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 219, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 220, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 221, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 222, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 223, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 224, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 225, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 226, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 227, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 228, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 229, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 230, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 231, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 232, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 233, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 234, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 235, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 236, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 237, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 238, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 239, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}].

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }
            ```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {209: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.5715152376571561, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 239: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it against the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves are consistent with a pattern where they play the move that would beat their opponent's last round move. For example, when I played 'rock', they played 'paper' in the next round, and when I played 'scissors', they played 'rock' in the next round.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - The opponent seems to consistently play the move that would beat my last move, regardless of whether they won, lost, or tied in the previous round. This suggests that their strategy is not influenced by the outcome of the previous round.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that predicts the opponent's observed moves most accurately is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move."

Given this analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy where they play the move that would beat my last move. Therefore, the best explanation for their behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move, and I last played paper, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.7000606663600093, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played 'rock' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat my 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.7900424664520065, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'scissors' last, I predict their next play will be 'rock' to beat my 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }
            ```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves don't consistently beat, lose to, or match their own previous moves. This rules out the first two strategies.
   - The opponent's moves don't consistently beat, lose to, or match my previous moves. This rules out the third and fourth strategies.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent doesn't consistently repeat their move or play the move that would beat their last move. This rules out the fifth strategy.
   - After a loss, the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that would lose to their last move. This rules out the sixth strategy.
   - After a tie, the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that would lose to their last move or repeat their move. This rules out the sixth strategy.

3. **Complex Strategy:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to depend on both the previous outcome and their previous transition. This suggests a more complex strategy.
   - The seventh strategy considers the opponent's previous outcome and transition, which aligns with the observed behavior.

Based on this analysis, the seventh strategy best explains the opponent's behavior. Therefore, the opponent is likely using the following strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Observing the opponent's pattern, they tend to play a sequence of moves that are countered by my last successful play. Given that I played 'rock' and won against 'scissors', the opponent might switch to 'paper' to counter my 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my best move would be 'scissors'.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the given history:

1. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be influenced by the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last round's move. For example, in round 244, they played 'rock' after losing with 'rock' in round 243.
   - After a win, they seem to play the same move as they did in the last round. For instance, in round 243, they played 'scissors' after winning with 'scissors' in round 242.
   - After a tie, they seem to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. For example, in round 238, they played 'scissors' after tying with 'scissors' in round 237.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - Wins: The opponent repeats their winning move.
   - Losses: The opponent switches to the move that would beat their last move.
   - Ties: The opponent switches to the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (rock beats scissors), they tend to play the move that would beat their last move. Since their last move was rock, they are likely to play paper next.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (they played rock against my scissors), they tend to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by my opponent, my best move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the patterns in their moves based on the interaction history provided.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves don't consistently beat or lose to their own previous moves, nor do they consistently beat or lose to my previous moves. This rules out the first two strategies.
   - The opponent doesn't consistently play the same move as my last move, ruling out the third strategy.
   - The opponent doesn't consistently play the move that would beat my last move, ruling out the fourth strategy.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, but not always. This suggests they might not be following a simple pattern of repeating moves after a win.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move, but this isn't consistent enough to confirm a simple pattern.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move, but again, this isn't consistent enough to confirm a simple pattern.

3. **Most Accurate Strategy:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be influenced by both the outcome of the previous round and the transition they made in the previous round. This suggests a more complex strategy that considers both the outcome and their previous transition.
   - The strategy that best fits this pattern is the last one, which involves different responses based on both the outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the transition made in the previous round.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the complex one that considers both the previous outcome and transition. Therefore, the selected strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {245: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.41193, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently follow a pattern of directly countering my last move. For instance, after I played 'scissors' in round 200 and won, the opponent played 'rock' in round 201, which would beat 'scissors'. However, this pattern does not hold consistently across other rounds.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent does not consistently repeat their last move or choose a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent does not consistently choose a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent does not consistently choose a move that would lose to their last move or repeat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not align with the simpler strategies of directly countering or repeating moves based on the last round's outcome.
   - The complex strategy involving transitions based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to fit better. This strategy considers the opponent's move two rounds ago and the outcome of the last round to decide the next move.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's moves, the strategy that best explains their behavior is the complex one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the observed variability in the opponent's responses and their lack of a consistent pattern based on simple win/loss/tie outcomes.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or change based on the previous round's outcome.
   - For example, in round 244, the opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'paper' in round 243. This suggests a possible shift in strategy after a loss.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - **Wins**: After winning, the opponent sometimes repeats the move (e.g., round 208 to 209) or changes it (e.g., round 209 to 210).
   - **Losses**: After losing, the opponent often changes their move to something different (e.g., round 244 to 245).
   - **Ties**: After ties, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, sometimes repeating the move (e.g., round 248 to 249) or changing it (e.g., round 211 to 212).

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy that considers both the outcome of the previous round and the move they made. Specifically, they often change their move after a loss and sometimes repeat it after a win or tie.
   - This behavior is consistent with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat their previous 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From round 202 to 251, the opponent's moves seem to follow a pattern where they often play a move that would lose to my previous move. For example, when I played 'rock', they often played 'scissors', and when I played 'paper', they played 'rock'.
   - However, there are instances where this pattern doesn't hold, such as when they played 'scissors' against my 'scissors' (round 211) or 'rock' against my 'scissors' (round 244).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, as seen in rounds 208-209 and 244-245.
   - After a loss, they often switch to a move that would beat their last move, as seen in rounds 244-245 and 246-247.
   - After a tie, they sometimes repeat their move, as seen in rounds 211-212 and 248-249.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they adjust their move based on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically, they tend to repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and sometimes repeat their move after a tie.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- **After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.**
- **After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.**
- **After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.**

This strategy seems to predict the opponent's moves most accurately based on the observed patterns.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies provided.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently beat, lose to, or match my previous moves. This rules out the strategies where the opponent plays the move that would beat or lose to their opponent's last round move, or plays the same move as their opponent's last round move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 204 to 205: opponent played rock after winning with rock) and sometimes changes it (e.g., round 203 to 204: opponent played paper after winning with paper).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes changes their move to one that would beat their last move (e.g., round 244 to 245: opponent played rock after losing with rock) and sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 246 to 247: opponent played rock again after losing with rock).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 211 to 212: opponent played rock after tying with rock) and sometimes changes it (e.g., round 252 to 253: opponent played scissors after tying with scissors).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit some of the behavior but not all.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" also fits some scenarios but not consistently.
   - The complex strategy involving transitions based on both previous outcomes and transitions seems to fit the observed behavior more closely, as it accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses after wins, losses, and ties.

Given the analysis, the opponent's behavior is best explained by the complex strategy involving transitions based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play rock, I should play paper to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their move.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays of rock, paper, and scissors seem to vary, suggesting they are not simply mirroring or countering my last move directly.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 244 to 245) and sometimes changes it (e.g., round 245 to 246).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes changes their move (e.g., round 244 to 245) and sometimes repeats it (e.g., round 246 to 247).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 252 to 253) and sometimes changes it (e.g., round 248 to 249).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently follow a simple pattern of repeating, countering, or losing to their last move.
   - The opponent's behavior seems to depend on both the outcome of the previous round and potentially the transition they made in the previous round.

Given these observations, the opponent's strategy seems to align with the most complex strategy described:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent frequently plays 'rock' and 'scissors', with occasional 'paper'.
   - They have a tendency to play 'rock' after losing to 'paper', which suggests a pattern of trying to beat 'paper' with 'rock'.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After losing to 'paper', the opponent often plays 'rock' in the next round.
   - After ties, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.
   - After winning, the opponent sometimes repeats the winning move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well.
   - This strategy explains the behavior of playing 'rock' after losing to 'paper' and sometimes repeating moves after ties or wins.

Given these observations, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the strategy where they repeat moves after wins, switch to a winning move after losses, and play a losing move after ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played rock and I played paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {240: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.423072345545037, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided interaction history and the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be consistent with a pattern where they often play the move that would beat their last move. For example, if they played 'rock' in one round, they might play 'paper' in the next round.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie, the opponent seems to play the move that would lose to their last move. For example, if the last round was a tie with both playing 'scissors', they might play 'paper' in the next round, which would lose to 'scissors'.
   - After a win, they seem to play the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, they seem to play the move that would beat their last move.

3. **Matching Strategy:**
   - The strategy that best fits the observed behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy aligns with the observed pattern of the opponent's moves, where they consistently play the move that would beat their last move after both wins and losses, and play the move that would lose to their last move after ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since their last move was scissors, they are likely to play paper next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves after my plays:
     - Round 257: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock' (opponent wins).
     - Round 256: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors' (tie).
     - Round 255: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock' (I win).
     - Round 254: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors' (tie).
     - Round 253: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock' (I win).
     - Round 252: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors' (tie).
     - Round 251: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock' (I win).
     - Round 250: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors' (I win).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win for the opponent (round 257), they played the move that would beat my last move (rock beats scissors).
   - After a tie (round 256), they repeated the same move (scissors).
   - After a loss (round 255), they played the move that would beat their last move (rock beats scissors).

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent seems to play the move that would beat my last move after they win.
   - After a tie, they seem to repeat the same move.
   - After a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Therefore, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they won), they will play the move that would lose to their last round's move, which was 'rock'. Therefore, their likely play in the next round is 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I played 'rock' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat my 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.8021138145219476, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'scissors' last, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat my 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }
            ```

Top hypotheses: {240: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.26147967016536344, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they play the move that would beat my last move (e.g., round 260: I played paper, they played scissors).
   - There are also instances where they play the same move as my last move (e.g., round 256: I played scissors, they played scissors).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 244 to 245: they won with rock and played rock again).
   - After a loss, they sometimes play the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 257: they lost with rock and played scissors next).
   - After a tie, they sometimes play the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 256: tie with scissors, then they played paper).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they adjust their move based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains the observed moves most accurately, as it accounts for the repetition after wins, the adjustment after losses, and the change after ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they won with scissors. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has played 'rock' in the last two rounds, resulting in ties.
   - Before that, they played 'scissors' against my 'paper' (round 260), resulting in a win for them.
   - They played 'paper' against my 'scissors' (round 259), resulting in a loss for them.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning in round 260 with 'scissors', they switched to 'rock' in round 261.
   - After tying in round 261 with 'rock', they played 'rock' again in round 262.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent's move after a win (round 260) was 'rock', which is the move that would beat their last move 'scissors'. This aligns with the strategy where after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a tie in round 261, they repeated the same move 'rock' in round 262, which aligns with the strategy where after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round.

Considering these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:
- After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

This aligns with the strategy described as:
"After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Thus, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie and they played rock, their likely play in the next round is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves don't consistently beat, lose to, or match my previous moves. This rules out the strategies where the opponent plays the move that would beat or lose to their opponent's last round move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 244 to 245: opponent played rock twice after winning with rock) and sometimes changes it.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 246 to 247: opponent played rock after losing with rock).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 227 to 228: opponent played rock, then paper after a tie with rock).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior:
     - After wins, the opponent often repeats their move.
     - After losses, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move.
     - After ties, the opponent often plays the move that would lose to their last move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing 'paper', the opponent is likely to play 'rock' next, as it would lose to 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's last move was 'scissors' after I played 'paper' and they won. This suggests they might be repeating their winning move.
   - Before that, when they played 'scissors' and I played 'paper', they won and played 'scissors' again.
   - When they lost, they often switch to a move that would beat their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After winning, the opponent seems to repeat their winning move.
   - After losing, they tend to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After ties, the pattern is less clear, but they sometimes repeat their move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well.
   - This strategy explains the opponent repeating their winning move and switching to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the following strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move or repeats the same move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit some of the observed behavior.
   - However, the strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." seems to account for more complex transitions based on both the outcome and the previous transition, which aligns with the observed variability in the opponent's moves.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the most fitting strategy is the one that considers both the outcome and the previous transition:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'rock' and won against the opponent's 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'scissors' last round, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played 'rock' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat my 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Top hypotheses: {240: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.30801319264048965, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine which strategy the opponent is using, let's analyze the recent rounds and see if we can identify a pattern.

1. **Round 267**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - My reward: 3 (I win)

   In this round, the opponent played Paper, which would lose to my Scissors.

2. **Round 268**: 
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - My reward: -1 (I lose)

   In this round, the opponent played Scissors, which beats my Paper. This suggests that the opponent might be playing the move that beats my last move.

3. **Round 269**:
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - My reward: -1 (I lose)

   Again, the opponent played Scissors, which beats my Paper. This is consistent with the opponent playing the move that beats my last move.

Now, let's consider the possible strategies:

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move**: This doesn't fit because the opponent's move in round 268 (Scissors) does not beat their move in round 267 (Paper).

- **The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move**: This doesn't fit because the opponent's move in round 268 (Scissors) does not lose to their move in round 267 (Paper).

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move**: This fits because the opponent played Scissors in round 268, which beats my move in round 267 (Paper).

- **The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move**: This doesn't fit because the opponent did not play Scissors in round 267, which was my move in round 266.

- **After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move**: This doesn't fit because the opponent did not play the same move after winning in round 267.

- **After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round**: This doesn't fit because the opponent did not play the move that would beat their move after winning in round 267.

- **The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made**: This is complex and doesn't seem to fit the observed pattern of simply playing the move that beats my last move.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move, and my last play was paper, I believe their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to frequently result in them losing, especially when I play 'rock'. This suggests they might be playing a move that is beaten by 'rock', such as 'scissors'.
   - There are instances where the opponent ties or loses consecutively, indicating a lack of adaptation or a predictable pattern.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After winning, the opponent does not consistently repeat the winning move, which rules out strategies where they play the same move after a win.
   - After losing, the opponent does not consistently switch to a move that beats their previous move, which rules out strategies where they adapt after a loss.
   - After ties, the opponent does not consistently change their move to avoid another tie, suggesting they might not be adapting based on ties either.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not seem to fit strategies that involve adapting based on the outcome (win, lose, tie) or repeating moves.
   - The most consistent pattern is that the opponent often plays a move that results in them losing to 'rock', which suggests they might be playing the move that would lose to their last round's move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is: "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would lose to their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'scissors', their next play is likely to be 'paper' (since paper loses to scissors).

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies provided.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary and do not consistently follow a pattern of playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move. This rules out the first two strategies.
   - The opponent does not consistently play the move that would beat my last move, nor do they consistently play the same move as my last move. This rules out the third and fourth strategies.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move and sometimes changes it. This inconsistency suggests they are not strictly following a pattern of repeating or changing moves after a win.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move, but not always. This inconsistency suggests they are not strictly following a pattern of changing moves after a loss.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move, but not consistently. This inconsistency suggests they are not strictly following a pattern of changing moves after a tie.

3. **Most Accurate Strategy:**
   - The most complex strategy, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition, seems to fit the observed behavior best. This strategy accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses after wins, losses, and ties, and matches the observed inconsistency in their behavior.

Given the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the variability and inconsistency observed in the opponent's moves.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played scissors and won against the opponent's paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my previous moves, especially when they win or lose. For instance, when I played 'paper' and they played 'scissors' (round 271), they won, and in the next round, they played 'scissors' again (round 272).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their winning move. For example, after winning with 'scissors' against my 'paper' in round 271, they played 'scissors' again in round 272.
   - After a loss, they seem to switch to a move that would beat their last move. For example, after losing with 'scissors' against my 'rock' in round 264, they played 'paper' in round 265.
   - After a tie, their behavior is less clear, but they sometimes repeat the same move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that fits this pattern is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

This strategy explains the observed behavior most accurately, as it accounts for the opponent's tendency to repeat winning moves and switch after losses.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the same move after a win, a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and a move that would lose to their last move after a tie. In the last round, they won with scissors against my paper. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'}.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch to a move that would beat or lose to my previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and switch to a losing move after a tie.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round where they played scissors against my rock, they are likely to play rock in the next round to beat their previous move.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {240: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.5896977772870872, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 269: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.53793, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would lose to their last move or repeats the same move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and switch to a losing move after a tie.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played 'paper' last, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9517283538000485, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'paper' last, I predict their next play will be 'scissors' to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted play of 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and since I last played paper, the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round to beat my paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, I should play rock in the next round.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9943208890962218, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9993318582812815, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be to play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{

  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent frequently plays 'rock' when I play 'scissors', suggesting a pattern of countering my moves effectively.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats the same move, especially when they win.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning with 'rock' against my 'scissors', the opponent often repeats 'rock'.
   - After losing, the opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat my last move.
   - After ties, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they repeat their winning move and switch to a counter-move after a loss.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as in the last round. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent frequently plays "rock" and "scissors" when I play "paper" and "rock" respectively, suggesting a potential pattern.
   - The opponent's moves often result in them losing when I play "paper," indicating they might not be adapting well to my strategy.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., round 293: opponent played "rock" after winning with "rock" in round 292).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 293: opponent played "rock" after losing with "scissors" in round 292).
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior seems inconsistent, but they sometimes repeat the same move.

3. **Strategy Comparison:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to align with the observed behavior:
     - After wins, the opponent often repeats the same move.
     - After losses, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
     - After ties, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but the strategy suggests they might play a losing move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous move.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the given interaction history and the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent frequently plays 'rock' when I play 'scissors', resulting in my loss.
   - When I play 'paper', the opponent often plays 'rock', resulting in my win.
   - When I play 'rock', the opponent often plays 'scissors', resulting in my win.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After I lose (e.g., when I play 'scissors' and they play 'rock'), the opponent tends to repeat the move that beat me.
   - After I win (e.g., when I play 'paper' and they play 'rock'), the opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After ties, there is no consistent pattern observed in the limited data provided.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last move after a win, and they repeat the winning move after a loss.
   - This aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they won), they will play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock', so they will play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays of rock, paper, and scissors don't consistently follow a pattern of beating, losing, or repeating my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 247-248, 250-251) and sometimes changes it (e.g., rounds 259-260).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes changes their move to beat their last move (e.g., rounds 257-258) and sometimes repeats it (e.g., rounds 293-294).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes changes their move to lose to their last move (e.g., rounds 296-297) and sometimes repeats it (e.g., rounds 258-259).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit some of the observed behavior, but not consistently.
   - The strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made" seems to account for the variability in the opponent's responses, as it considers both the outcome and the transition type.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the last strategy seems to best explain the observed moves, as it accounts for different transitions based on both the outcome and the previous transition type.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, we both played rock, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Since they played rock last, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter would be to play scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'rock' next, as it would lose to their last move 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
