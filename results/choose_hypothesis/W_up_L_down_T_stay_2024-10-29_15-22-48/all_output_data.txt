User Message: 
            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 1, {'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}].

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            self_transition_up: The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would beat their last rounds move
self_transition_down: The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
opponent_transition_up: The opponent plays the best response to my last move
opponent_transition_stay: The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round
W_stay_L_up_T_down: After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move
W_up_L_down_T_stay: After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round
prev_outcome_prev_transition: The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output it in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is 'opponent_transition_up', and they played 'paper' last round, I believe their next play will be 'scissors' as they might transition to the next option in the sequence (rock -> paper -> scissors).

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely next play is paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 6, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}].

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            self_transition_up: The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would beat their last rounds move
self_transition_down: The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
opponent_transition_up: The opponent plays the best response to my last move
opponent_transition_stay: The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round
W_stay_L_up_T_down: After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move
W_up_L_down_T_stay: After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round
prev_outcome_prev_transition: The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output it in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of 'prev_outcome_prev_transition', they tend to adapt based on the outcome of the previous round. In the last round, I played scissors and won against their paper. If they adapt by choosing what would have beaten my last play, they might choose rock next.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of 'opponent_transition_up', they seem to cycle through rock, paper, and scissors in that order. In the last round, they played rock. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent's strategy seems to be based on the previous outcome and transition. In the last round, both played scissors resulting in a tie.

Therefore, it is likely that the opponent will play scissors again.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is 'opponent_transition_up', they seem to be cycling through their plays in a specific order. Observing the pattern, after playing 'paper', they tend to play 'scissors' next. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my best move would be to play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Selected strategy: opponent_transition_up

User Message: 
            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 14, {'round': 13, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 6, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 7, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 9, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 10, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 11, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 12, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 13, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}].

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            self_transition_up: The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would beat their last rounds move
self_transition_down: The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
opponent_transition_up: The opponent plays the best response to my last move
opponent_transition_stay: The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round
W_stay_L_up_T_down: After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move
W_up_L_down_T_stay: After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round
prev_outcome_prev_transition: The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output it in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of 'W_stay_L_up_T_down', they tend to repeat their move if they win, switch to the next move in the cycle (rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock) if they lose, and switch to the previous move in the cycle if they tie. In the last round, they played scissors and lost to my rock. According to their strategy, they will likely switch to the next move in the cycle, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```
