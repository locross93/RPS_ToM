To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the given interaction:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: Tie

Given the outcome was a tie, let's evaluate each strategy to see which one aligns with the opponent's move:

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - If the opponent played Paper last round, they would play Scissors next. This does not match the observed move (Paper).

- **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - If the opponent played Paper last round, they would play Rock next. This does not match the observed move (Paper).

- **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - If I played Paper last round, the opponent would play Scissors next. This does not match the observed move (Paper).

- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - If I played Paper last round, the opponent would play Paper next. This matches the observed move (Paper).

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - After a tie, the opponent would play Rock (loses to Paper). This does not match the observed move (Paper).

- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - After a tie, the opponent would play Paper (same as last round). This matches the observed move (Paper).

- **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made.
  - After a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. Since we only have one round, this strategy cannot be evaluated yet.

Based on the analysis, Strategies 4 and 6 both predict the opponent's move accurately. However, Strategy 6 provides a more comprehensive explanation considering different outcomes (win, loss, tie). Therefore, Strategy 6 is the most fitting explanation for the opponent's behavior so far.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since they played 'paper' in the last round, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: Tie

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Tie

Now, let's evaluate the possible strategies:

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move:** 
  - If this were true, after playing Paper in Round 0, the opponent would play Scissors in Round 1. However, they played Scissors, which does not beat Scissors. This strategy does not fit.

- **The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move:** 
  - If this were true, after playing Paper in Round 0, the opponent would play Rock in Round 1. However, they played Scissors, which does not lose to Scissors. This strategy does not fit.

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move:** 
  - If this were true, after I played Paper in Round 0, the opponent would play Scissors in Round 1. They did play Scissors, which fits this strategy.

- **The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move:** 
  - If this were true, after I played Paper in Round 0, the opponent would play Paper in Round 1. However, they played Scissors. This strategy does not fit.

- **After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move:** 
  - After a tie in Round 0, the opponent should play Rock in Round 1 (to lose to Paper), but they played Scissors. This strategy does not fit.

- **After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round:** 
  - After a tie in Round 0, the opponent should play Paper in Round 1 (same as last round), but they played Scissors. This strategy does not fit.

- **Complex strategy based on previous outcomes and transitions:** 
  - This strategy is complex and requires more data to analyze properly. However, given the current data, it does not seem to fit as the opponent's moves do not align with the expected transitions.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior so far is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move, and I last played scissors, I believe their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter this.

Top hypotheses: {2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Result: Tie

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Result: Tie

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Result: I win

Now, let's evaluate the possible strategies:

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move:**
  - Round 0: Paper -> Round 1: Scissors (This matches)
  - Round 1: Scissors -> Round 2: Rock (This does not match)

- **The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move:**
  - Round 0: Paper -> Round 1: Rock (This does not match)
  - Round 1: Scissors -> Round 2: Paper (This does not match)

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move:**
  - Round 0: My Paper -> Round 1: Scissors (This matches)
  - Round 1: My Scissors -> Round 2: Rock (This does not match)

- **The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move:**
  - Round 0: My Paper -> Round 1: Paper (This does not match)
  - Round 1: My Scissors -> Round 2: Scissors (This does not match)

- **After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move:**
  - Round 0: Tie, Paper -> Round 1: Rock (This does not match)
  - Round 1: Tie, Scissors -> Round 2: Rock (This does not match)

- **After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round:**
  - Round 0: Tie, Paper -> Round 1: Paper (This does not match)
  - Round 1: Tie, Scissors -> Round 2: Scissors (This does not match)

- **Complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and transition:**
  - This strategy is complex and involves multiple conditions. However, given the limited data, it is difficult to match this strategy precisely without more rounds.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that matches the observed behavior most closely is "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move" for the first transition, but it fails on the second transition. Given the limited data, it's challenging to pinpoint a perfect match. However, the closest match initially is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'paper' to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

Top hypotheses: {2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior so far, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Result: Tie

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Result: Tie

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Result: I win

4. **Round 3:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Result: Tie

Now, let's evaluate the possible strategies:

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit because in round 1, they played Scissors again after playing Paper, which doesn't beat Paper.

- **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit because in round 1, they played Scissors again after playing Paper, which doesn't lose to Paper.

- **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit because in round 1, they played Scissors after I played Paper, which doesn't beat Paper.

- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit because in round 1, they played Scissors after I played Paper.

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit because in round 1, after a tie, they played Scissors again, which doesn't lose to Scissors.

- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - This fits because:
    - In round 1, after a tie, they played Scissors again (same move).
    - In round 3, after a tie, they played Scissors again (same move).

- **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
  - This is complex and doesn't seem necessary given the current data.

Based on the analysis, **Strategy 6** best explains the opponent's behavior so far. They seem to repeat their move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie and they played scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

  - This doesn't fit as the opponent played the same move as me in rounds 0, 1, 3, and 4.

- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent played Rock in round 2 when I played Paper in round 1.

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent repeated the same move in rounds 1 and 3 after ties.

- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - This fits the pattern observed: after ties in rounds 0, 1, 3, and 4, the opponent repeated the same move.

- **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
  - This strategy is complex and doesn't seem necessary given the simpler fit of Strategy 6.

Based on the analysis, **Strategy 6** best explains the opponent's behavior so far.

```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

Top hypotheses: {2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.15990000000000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves and outcomes:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Next move: Scissors

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Next move: Rock

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next move: Scissors

4. **Round 3:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Next move: Rock

5. **Round 4:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Next move: Scissors

6. **Round 5:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Opponent wins

**Analysis:**

- After a tie, the opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last move (e.g., after playing Paper in Round 0, they played Scissors in Round 1; after playing Scissors in Round 1, they played Rock in Round 2).
- After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., after winning with Scissors in Round 5, they would likely play Rock next).
- The opponent's behavior after a tie and a win aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

This strategy best explains the opponent's behavior so far.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, their next play is likely to be rock, as it beats scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: 
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Result: Tie

2. **Round 1**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Result: Tie

3. **Round 2**: 
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Result: I win

4. **Round 3**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Result: Tie

5. **Round 4**: 
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Result: Tie

6. **Round 5**: 
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Result: I lose

7. **Round 6**: 
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Result: I win

Now, let's analyze the opponent's behavior:

- **After a tie (Round 0 to 1)**: The opponent played the same move (Paper to Paper, Scissors to Scissors).
- **After a win (Round 2 to 3)**: The opponent switched from Rock to Scissors, which is not directly explained by a simple strategy.
- **After a tie (Round 3 to 4)**: The opponent played the same move (Scissors to Rock).
- **After a tie (Round 4 to 5)**: The opponent switched from Rock to Scissors.
- **After a loss (Round 5 to 6)**: The opponent switched from Scissors to Rock.

The opponent's behavior seems to be inconsistent with simple strategies like playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move. However, the opponent's behavior after ties and losses suggests a pattern where they sometimes repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat their previous move.

The strategy that best fits this pattern is:
- After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

This strategy explains the opponent's behavior in rounds 0 to 1, 3 to 4, and 5 to 6.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round, as it would lose to their last move 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: Both played 'paper', resulting in a tie. 
   - Possible strategies: 
     - "The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move" (since it's the first round, this doesn't apply yet).
     - "After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" (opponent should play 'rock' next).
     - "After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" (opponent should play 'paper' next).
     - "After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move." (not applicable yet).

2. **Round 1**: Both played 'scissors', resulting in a tie.
   - Possible strategies:
     - "The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move" (opponent should play 'scissors' next).
     - "After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" (opponent should play 'rock' next).
     - "After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" (opponent should play 'scissors' next).
     - "After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move." (opponent should play 'rock' next).

3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock', I won.
   - Possible strategies:
     - "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move" (opponent should play 'scissors' next).
     - "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" (opponent should play 'rock' next).
     - "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move" (opponent should play 'paper' next).

     - "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" (opponent should play 'rock' next).
     - "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move" (opponent should play 'paper' next).
     - "After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move." (opponent should play 'scissors' next).

8. **Round 7**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors', I won.
   - Possible strategies:
     - "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move" (opponent should play 'paper' next).
     - "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" (opponent should play 'scissors' next).
     - "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move" (opponent should play 'rock' next).
     - "After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move." (opponent should play 'rock' next).

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to align most closely with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the opponent's moves in rounds 2, 5, 6, and 7, where they played moves that would beat their last rounds move after a win, and moves that would lose to their last rounds move after a loss.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play paper next, as it would lose to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter-move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

User Message: 
            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 9, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 6, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 7, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}].

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Tie (Paper vs. Paper)
   - Next move: Scissors (Round 1)
   - Possible strategies: 
     - "After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move" (Paper -> Scissors)

2. **Round 1**: Tie (Scissors vs. Scissors)
   - Next move: Rock (Round 2)
   - Possible strategies:
     - "After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move" (Scissors -> Rock)

3. **Round 2**: Loss (Rock vs. Paper)
   - Next move: Scissors (Round 3)
   - Possible strategies:
     - "After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move" (Rock -> Scissors)

4. **Round 3**: Tie (Scissors vs. Scissors)
   - Next move: Rock (Round 4)
   - Possible strategies:
     - "After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move" (Scissors -> Rock)

5. **Round 4**: Tie (Rock vs. Rock)
   - Next move: Scissors (Round 5)
   - Possible strategies:
     - "After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move" (Rock -> Scissors)

6. **Round 5**: Win (Scissors vs. Paper)
   - Next move: Rock (Round 6)
   - Possible strategies:
     - "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move" (Scissors -> Rock)

7. **Round 6**: Loss (Rock vs. Paper)
   - Next move: Scissors (Round 7)
   - Possible strategies:
     - "After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move" (Rock -> Scissors)

8. **Round 7**: Loss (Scissors vs. Rock)
   - Next move: Paper (Round 8)
   - Possible strategies:
     - "After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move" (Scissors -> Paper)

From the analysis, the opponent's moves seem to align with the strategy: "After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move," and "After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move." This pattern is consistent with the observed moves.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it would beat their last move, 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.882351, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played rock and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play scissors next, as scissors would lose to rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best move to counter this would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.34235199000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: Both played paper, resulting in a tie. In round 1, the opponent played scissors, which beats paper. This could align with the strategy where after a tie, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

2. **Round 1**: Both played scissors, resulting in a tie. In round 2, the opponent played rock, which beats scissors. This again aligns with the strategy where after a tie, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

3. **Round 2**: I played paper, and the opponent played rock, resulting in my win. In round 3, the opponent played scissors, which beats paper. This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

4. **Round 3**: Both played scissors, resulting in a tie. In round 4, the opponent played rock, which beats scissors. This aligns with the strategy where after a tie, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

5. **Round 4**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie. In round 5, the opponent played scissors, which loses to rock. This could align with the strategy where after a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

6. **Round 5**: I played paper, and the opponent played scissors, resulting in my loss. In round 6, the opponent played rock, which beats scissors. This aligns with the strategy where after a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

7. **Round 6**: I played paper, and the opponent played rock, resulting in my win. In round 7, the opponent played scissors, which beats paper. This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

8. **Round 7**: I played rock, and the opponent played scissors, resulting in my win. In round 8, the opponent played paper, which beats rock. This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

9. **Round 8**: I played scissors, and the opponent played paper, resulting in my win. In round 9, the opponent played rock, which beats scissors. This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

10. **Round 9**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie. In round 10, the opponent played paper, which beats rock. This aligns with the strategy where after a tie, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

11. **Round 10**: I played scissors, and the opponent played paper, resulting in my win. In round 11, the opponent played rock, which beats scissors. This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

12. **Round 11**: I played paper, and the opponent played rock, resulting in my win. In round 12, the opponent played scissors, which beats paper. This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

13. **Round 12**: I played rock, and the opponent played scissors, resulting in my win. In round 13, the opponent played paper, which beats rock. This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

14. **Round 13**: Both played paper, resulting in a tie. The opponent's next move is unknown, but based on the pattern, they might play scissors, which beats paper.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to align most closely with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move."

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing paper, the opponent is likely to play scissors next to beat paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Round 0 to 1**: 
   - Opponent played 'paper' after 'paper' (tie).
   - Possible strategies: "plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move", "After a tie, plays the same move".

2. **Round 1 to 2**:
   - Opponent played 'rock' after 'scissors' (tie).
   - Possible strategies: "plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move", "After a tie, plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move".

3. **Round 2 to 3**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'rock' (loss).
   - Possible strategies: "plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move", "After a loss, plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move".

4. **Round 3 to 4**:
   - Opponent played 'rock' after 'scissors' (tie).
   - Possible strategies: "plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move", "After a tie, plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move".

5. **Round 4 to 5**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'rock' (tie).
   - Possible strategies: "plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move", "After a tie, plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move".

6. **Round 5 to 6**:
   - Opponent played 'rock' after 'scissors' (win).
   - Possible strategies: "plays the move that would beat their last rounds move", "After a win, plays the same move".

7. **Round 6 to 7**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'rock' (loss).
   - Possible strategies: "plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move", "After a loss, plays the move that would beat their last rounds move".

8. **Round 7 to 8**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' after 'scissors' (loss).
   - Possible strategies: "plays the move that would beat their last rounds move", "After a loss, plays the move that would beat their last rounds move".

9. **Round 8 to 9**:
   - Opponent played 'rock' after 'paper' (loss).
   - Possible strategies: "plays the move that would beat their last rounds move", "After a loss, plays the move that would beat their last rounds move".

10. **Round 9 to 10**:
    - Opponent played 'paper' after 'rock' (tie).
    - Possible strategies: "plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move", "After a tie, plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move".

11. **Round 10 to 11**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' after 'paper' (loss).
    - Possible strategies: "plays the move that would beat their last rounds move", "After a loss, plays the move that would beat their last rounds move".

12. **Round 11 to 12**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'rock' (loss).
    - Possible strategies: "plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move", "After a loss, plays the move that would beat their last rounds move".

13. **Round 12 to 13**:
    - Opponent played 'paper' after 'scissors' (loss).
    - Possible strategies: "plays the move that would beat their last rounds move", "After a loss, plays the move that would beat their last rounds move".

14. **Round 13 to 14**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'paper' (tie).
    - Possible strategies: "plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move", "After a tie, plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move".

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is: "After a win, plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played scissors and I played rock), they will likely play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

After a tie, plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves based on the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Opponent played 'paper' against my 'paper' (tie).
2. **Round 1**: Opponent played 'scissors' against my 'scissors' (tie).
3. **Round 2**: Opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper' (loss for opponent).
4. **Round 3**: Opponent played 'scissors' against my 'scissors' (tie).
5. **Round 4**: Opponent played 'rock' against my 'rock' (tie).
6. **Round 5**: Opponent played 'scissors' against my 'paper' (win for opponent).
7. **Round 6**: Opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper' (loss for opponent).
8. **Round 7**: Opponent played 'scissors' against my 'rock' (loss for opponent).
9. **Round 8**: Opponent played 'paper' against my 'scissors' (loss for opponent).
10. **Round 9**: Opponent played 'rock' against my 'rock' (tie).
11. **Round 10**: Opponent played 'paper' against my 'scissors' (loss for opponent).
12. **Round 11**: Opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper' (loss for opponent).
13. **Round 12**: Opponent played 'scissors' against my 'rock' (loss for opponent).
14. **Round 13**: Opponent played 'paper' against my 'paper' (tie).
15. **Round 14**: Opponent played 'scissors' against my 'rock' (loss for opponent).
16. **Round 15**: Opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper' (loss for opponent).

Now, let's analyze the patterns:

- The opponent seems to play 'rock' frequently after losing, which suggests they might be trying to counter a perceived pattern.
- After ties, the opponent's moves are inconsistent, sometimes repeating the same move or switching to another.
- The opponent's moves do not consistently follow a pattern of beating or losing to their last move or my last move.

Given the complexity and variability in their responses, the strategy that best fits their behavior is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the opponent's inconsistent responses to wins, losses, and ties, and their tendency to switch moves based on the previous round's outcome and transition.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (round 14, opponent played 'scissors'), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.77442673257, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played scissors, resulting in a tie. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock' to ensure a win.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: Tie (Paper vs. Paper)
   - The opponent played the same move as my last move.

2. **Round 1**: Tie (Scissors vs. Scissors)
   - The opponent played the same move as my last move.

3. **Round 2**: I win (Paper vs. Rock)
   - The opponent played the move that would lose to my last move.

4. **Round 3**: Tie (Scissors vs. Scissors)
   - The opponent played the same move as my last move.

5. **Round 4**: Tie (Rock vs. Rock)
   - The opponent played the same move as my last move.

6. **Round 5**: I lose (Paper vs. Scissors)
   - The opponent played the move that would beat my last move.

7. **Round 6**: I win (Paper vs. Rock)
   - The opponent played the move that would lose to my last move.

8. **Round 7**: I win (Rock vs. Scissors)
   - The opponent played the move that would lose to my last move.

9. **Round 8**: I win (Scissors vs. Paper)
   - The opponent played the move that would lose to my last move.

10. **Round 9**: Tie (Rock vs. Rock)
    - The opponent played the same move as my last move.

11. **Round 10**: I win (Scissors vs. Paper)
    - The opponent played the move that would lose to my last move.

12. **Round 11**: I win (Paper vs. Rock)
    - The opponent played the move that would lose to my last move.

13. **Round 12**: I win (Rock vs. Scissors)
    - The opponent played the move that would lose to my last move.

14. **Round 13**: Tie (Paper vs. Paper)
    - The opponent played the same move as my last move.

15. **Round 14**: I win (Rock vs. Scissors)
    - The opponent played the move that would lose to my last move.

16. **Round 15**: I win (Paper vs. Rock)
    - The opponent played the move that would lose to my last move.

17. **Round 16**: Tie (Scissors vs. Scissors)
    - The opponent played the same move as my last move.

18. **Round 17**: I win (Paper vs. Rock)
    - The opponent played the move that would lose to my last move.

19. **Round 18**: I win (Rock vs. Scissors)
    - The opponent played the move that would lose to my last move.

20. **Round 19**: I win (Scissors vs. Paper)
    - The opponent played the move that would lose to my last move.

21. **Round 20**: Tie (Paper vs. Paper)
    - The opponent played the same move as my last move.

**Analysis:**

- The opponent seems to play the same move as my last move when the round ends in a tie.
- When I win, the opponent tends to play the move that would lose to my last move.
- When I lose, the opponent plays the move that would beat my last move.

The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie and they played 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Analyzing the interaction history:**
   - Rounds 0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 13, 16, 20, 21: Ties occurred. The opponent played the same move as the previous round in most cases, except for round 4 to 5, where they changed from rock to scissors.
   - Rounds 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19: I won. The opponent's response varied, sometimes repeating their move, sometimes changing.
   - Round 5: I lost. The opponent played scissors after playing rock in round 4.

2. **Checking for patterns:**
   - The opponent often repeats their move after a tie, but not always.
   - After I win, the opponent's response is inconsistent.
   - After I lose, the opponent seems to change their move.

3. **Comparing with strategies:**
   - "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move" doesn't fit, as they don't consistently play the winning move.
   - "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" doesn't fit, as they don't consistently play the losing move.
   - "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move" doesn't fit, as they don't consistently counter my last move.
   - "The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move" doesn't fit, as they don't consistently mirror my last move.
   - "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" doesn't fit, as their behavior after ties and losses doesn't match.
   - "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" partially fits, but not consistently.
   - The complex strategy involving transitions based on both the previous outcome and transition seems too complex given the observed behavior.

The most fitting strategy based on observed behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round." However, this doesn't perfectly match all rounds, indicating some randomness or deviation.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }
            ```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent has played 'rock' in rounds 0, 4, 9, 13, 20, and 22.
   - The opponent has played 'scissors' in rounds 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, 16, and 21.
   - The opponent has played 'paper' in rounds 2, 6, 8, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, and 19.

2. **Response to My Moves:**
   - After I played 'paper' in round 0, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 1.
   - After I played 'scissors' in round 1, the opponent played 'rock' in round 2.
   - After I played 'paper' in round 2, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 3.
   - After I played 'scissors' in round 3, the opponent played 'rock' in round 4.
   - After I played 'rock' in round 4, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 5.
   - After I played 'paper' in round 5, the opponent played 'rock' in round 6.
   - After I played 'paper' in round 6, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 7.
   - After I played 'rock' in round 7, the opponent played 'paper' in round 8.
   - After I played 'scissors' in round 8, the opponent played 'rock' in round 9.
   - After I played 'rock' in round 9, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 10.
   - After I played 'scissors' in round 10, the opponent played 'paper' in round 11.
   - After I played 'paper' in round 11, the opponent played 'rock' in round 12.
   - After I played 'rock' in round 12, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 13.
   - After I played 'paper' in round 13, the opponent played 'rock' in round 14.
   - After I played 'rock' in round 14, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 15.
   - After I played 'paper' in round 15, the opponent played 'rock' in round 16.
   - After I played 'scissors' in round 16, the opponent played 'paper' in round 17.
   - After I played 'paper' in round 17, the opponent played 'rock' in round 18.
   - After I played 'rock' in round 18, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 19.
   - After I played 'scissors' in round 19, the opponent played 'paper' in round 20.
   - After I played 'paper' in round 20, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 21.
   - After I played 'scissors' in round 21, the opponent played 'rock' in round 22.

3. **Behavior Based on Outcome:**
   - After a win, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - After a tie, the opponent tends to play the same move as they did in the last round.

4. **Strategy Matching:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Based on the analysis, the opponent's strategy is most likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock from my opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played 'paper', resulting in a tie. According to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' next to beat their last move 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round, my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played 'paper' and I played 'scissors'), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves based on the given history:

1. **Round 0 to 1**: Both played paper, then both played scissors. This suggests the opponent might be mirroring my moves.
2. **Round 1 to 2**: Opponent played scissors, then rock. This could indicate they are playing the move that beats their last move.
3. **Round 2 to 3**: Opponent played rock, then scissors. This suggests they are not consistently playing the move that beats their last move.
4. **Round 3 to 4**: Both played scissors, then both played rock. This again suggests mirroring.
5. **Round 4 to 5**: Both played rock, then opponent played scissors. This doesn't fit a clear pattern.
6. **Round 5 to 6**: Opponent played scissors, then rock. This suggests playing the move that beats their last move.
7. **Round 6 to 7**: Opponent played rock, then scissors. This suggests playing the move that loses to their last move.
8. **Round 7 to 8**: Opponent played scissors, then paper. This suggests playing the move that loses to their last move.
9. **Round 8 to 9**: Opponent played paper, then rock. This suggests playing the move that beats their last move.
10. **Round 9 to 10**: Both played rock, then opponent played paper. This suggests playing the move that beats their last move.
11. **Round 10 to 11**: Opponent played paper, then rock. This suggests playing the move that loses to their last move.
12. **Round 11 to 12**: Opponent played rock, then scissors. This suggests playing the move that loses to their last move.
13. **Round 12 to 13**: Opponent played scissors, then paper. This suggests playing the move that loses to their last move.
14. **Round 13 to 14**: Both played paper, then opponent played rock. This suggests playing the move that beats their last move.
15. **Round 14 to 15**: Opponent played rock, then paper. This suggests playing the move that beats their last move.
16. **Round 15 to 16**: Opponent played paper, then scissors. This suggests playing the move that beats their last move.
17. **Round 16 to 17**: Both played scissors, then opponent played rock. This suggests playing the move that beats their last move.
18. **Round 17 to 18**: Opponent played rock, then scissors. This suggests playing the move that loses to their last move.
19. **Round 18 to 19**: Opponent played scissors, then paper. This suggests playing the move that loses to their last move.
20. **Round 19 to 20**: Opponent played paper, then paper again. This suggests mirroring or playing the same move after a tie.
21. **Round 20 to 21**: Both played paper, then both played scissors. This suggests mirroring.
22. **Round 21 to 22**: Both played scissors, then both played rock. This suggests mirroring.
23. **Round 22 to 23**: Both played rock, then both played paper. This suggests mirroring.
24. **Round 23 to 24**: Both played paper, then opponent played paper again. This suggests playing the same move after a tie.
25. **Round 24 to 25**: Opponent played paper, then scissors. This suggests playing the move that beats their last move.
26. **Round 25 to 26**: Opponent played scissors, then rock. This suggests playing the move that beats their last move.

Based on the analysis, the opponent seems to be playing the move that beats their last move most frequently. However, there are instances of mirroring and playing the same move after a tie. The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move, and their last move was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'paper' to beat 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

From the analysis, it seems that the opponent is consistently playing the move that would lose to their last round's move. This pattern fits the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Therefore, the best explanation for the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would lose to their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'rock' because 'rock' would lose to 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

The opponent's behavior seems to consistently follow the strategy where after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move; after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move; and after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'paper' next to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays in response to my moves:
     - Round 0: Tie (paper vs paper)
     - Round 1: Tie (scissors vs scissors)
     - Round 2: Loss (rock vs paper)
     - Round 3: Tie (scissors vs scissors)
     - Round 4: Tie (rock vs rock)
     - Round 5: Win (scissors vs paper)
     - Round 6: Loss (rock vs paper)
     - Round 7: Loss (scissors vs rock)
     - Round 8: Loss (paper vs scissors)
     - Round 9: Tie (rock vs rock)
     - Round 10: Loss (paper vs scissors)
     - Round 11: Loss (rock vs paper)
     - Round 12: Loss (scissors vs rock)
     - Round 13: Tie (paper vs paper)
     - Round 14: Loss (scissors vs rock)
     - Round 15: Loss (rock vs paper)
     - Round 16: Tie (scissors vs scissors)
     - Round 17: Loss (rock vs paper)
     - Round 18: Loss (scissors vs rock)
     - Round 19: Loss (paper vs scissors)
     - Round 20: Tie (paper vs paper)
     - Round 21: Tie (scissors vs scissors)
     - Round 22: Tie (rock vs rock)
     - Round 23: Tie (paper vs paper)
     - Round 24: Win (paper vs rock)
     - Round 25: Loss (paper vs scissors)
     - Round 26: Tie (rock vs rock)
     - Round 27: Loss (paper vs scissors)
     - Round 28: Loss (rock vs paper)
     - Round 29: Tie (scissors vs scissors)

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win (round 5, 24), the opponent played the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors after paper, paper after rock).
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (e.g., round 2: rock after paper, round 6: rock after paper).
   - After a tie, the opponent often plays the same move as they did in the last round (e.g., round 0: paper after paper, round 1: scissors after scissors).

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: Both played paper, resulting in a tie. The opponent played paper again in round 1, which matches the strategy where after a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

2. **Round 1**: Both played scissors, resulting in a tie. The opponent played rock in round 2, which does not match the strategy of playing the same move after a tie.

3. **Round 2**: I played paper, the opponent played rock, and I won. In round 3, the opponent played scissors, which would beat my last move (paper). This matches the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

25. **Round 24**: I played rock, the opponent played paper, and I lost. In round 25, the opponent played paper again, which matches the strategy where after a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

26. **Round 25**: I played scissors, the opponent played paper, and I won. In round 26, the opponent played rock, which would beat my last move (scissors). This matches the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

27. **Round 26**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie. The opponent played paper in round 27, which does not match the strategy of playing the same move after a tie.

31. **Round 30**: I played rock, the opponent played paper, and I lost. In round 31, the opponent played paper again, which matches the strategy where after a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

From the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to align most consistently with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

Therefore, the chosen strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

    - Opponent stayed with Scissors.

31. **Round 30**: Loss (Rock vs. Paper)
    - Opponent switched from Scissors to Paper.

32. **Round 31**: Win (Scissors vs. Paper)
    - Opponent switched from Paper to Paper.

**Analysis:**

- The opponent often switches moves after a win, suggesting they might be trying to predict my next move.
- They tend to repeat their move after a tie.
- After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their last move, but not consistently.

The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost, so they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Round 0 to 1**: Opponent played 'paper' and then 'scissors'. This could align with playing the move that would beat their last move ('paper' to 'scissors').

2. **Round 1 to 2**: Opponent played 'scissors' and then 'rock'. This could align with playing the move that would beat their last move ('scissors' to 'rock').

3. **Round 2 to 3**: Opponent played 'rock' and then 'scissors'. This could align with playing the move that would lose to their last move ('rock' to 'scissors').

4. **Round 3 to 4**: Opponent played 'scissors' and then 'rock'. This could align with playing the move that would beat their last move ('scissors' to 'rock').

5. **Round 4 to 5**: Opponent played 'rock' and then 'scissors'. This could align with playing the move that would lose to their last move ('rock' to 'scissors').

31. **Round 30 to 31**: Opponent played 'rock' and then 'paper'. This could align with playing the move that would beat their last move ('rock' to 'paper').

32. **Round 31 to 32**: Opponent played 'paper' and then 'rock'. This could align with playing the move that would lose to their last move ('paper' to 'rock').

The pattern suggests that the opponent is playing the move that would beat their last move. This aligns with the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and since they played 'rock' last round, I predict their next play will be 'paper' to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has played 'scissors' multiple times when I played 'scissors', resulting in ties.
   - When I played 'rock', the opponent played 'rock' or 'paper', resulting in ties or losses for me.
   - When I played 'paper', the opponent played 'rock' or 'scissors', resulting in wins or losses for me.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie, the opponent often repeats the same move (e.g., multiple 'scissors' ties).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., after losing with 'rock', they play 'paper').
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the winning move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent's behavior after ties suggests they might be repeating their last move.
   - The opponent's behavior after losses suggests they might switch to a move that beats their last move.
   - The opponent's behavior after wins is less consistent, but sometimes they repeat the winning move or switch to a move that beats their last move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

This strategy aligns with the observed patterns of repeating moves after ties and switching moves after losses.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Round 0-1**: Both players played the same move, resulting in a tie. The opponent repeated their move in the next round, which aligns with the strategy where after a tie, the opponent plays the same move.

2. **Round 1-2**: Another tie occurred, and the opponent switched from scissors to rock, which could suggest a strategy where they play the move that would beat their last move.

3. **Round 2-3**: The opponent lost, and they repeated their move (rock to rock), which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the same move.

4. **Round 3-4**: Another tie, and the opponent repeated their move again, which aligns with the strategy where after a tie, they play the same move.

5. **Round 4-5**: The opponent lost, and they switched from rock to scissors, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

6. **Round 5-6**: The opponent won, and they switched from scissors to rock, which aligns with the strategy where after a win, they play the move that would beat their last move.

7. **Round 6-7**: The opponent lost, and they switched from rock to scissors, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

8. **Round 7-8**: The opponent lost, and they switched from scissors to paper, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

9. **Round 8-9**: The opponent lost, and they switched from paper to rock, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

10. **Round 9-10**: A tie occurred, and the opponent switched from rock to paper, which does not align with the strategy where after a tie, they play the same move.

11. **Round 10-11**: The opponent lost, and they switched from paper to rock, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

12. **Round 11-12**: The opponent lost, and they switched from rock to scissors, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

13. **Round 12-13**: The opponent won, and they switched from scissors to paper, which aligns with the strategy where after a win, they play the move that would beat their last move.

14. **Round 13-14**: A tie occurred, and the opponent switched from paper to rock, which does not align with the strategy where after a tie, they play the same move.

15. **Round 14-15**: The opponent lost, and they switched from rock to paper, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

16. **Round 15-16**: The opponent lost, and they switched from paper to scissors, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

17. **Round 16-17**: A tie occurred, and the opponent switched from scissors to rock, which does not align with the strategy where after a tie, they play the same move.

18. **Round 17-18**: The opponent lost, and they switched from rock to paper, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

19. **Round 18-19**: The opponent lost, and they switched from paper to scissors, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

20. **Round 19-20**: The opponent won, and they switched from scissors to paper, which aligns with the strategy where after a win, they play the move that would beat their last move.

21. **Round 20-21**: A tie occurred, and the opponent switched from paper to rock, which does not align with the strategy where after a tie, they play the same move.

22. **Round 21-22**: The opponent lost, and they switched from rock to paper, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

23. **Round 22-23**: A tie occurred, and the opponent switched from paper to rock, which does not align with the strategy where after a tie, they play the same move.

24. **Round 23-24**: The opponent lost, and they switched from rock to paper, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

25. **Round 24-25**: The opponent won, and they switched from paper to scissors, which aligns with the strategy where after a win, they play the move that would beat their last move.

26. **Round 25-26**: The opponent lost, and they switched from scissors to rock, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

27. **Round 26-27**: A tie occurred, and the opponent switched from rock to paper, which does not align with the strategy where after a tie, they play the same move.

28. **Round 27-28**: The opponent lost, and they switched from paper to scissors, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

29. **Round 28-29**: The opponent lost, and they switched from scissors to rock, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

30. **Round 29-30**: A tie occurred, and the opponent switched from rock to paper, which does not align with the strategy where after a tie, they play the same move.

31. **Round 30-31**: The opponent lost, and they switched from paper to scissors, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

32. **Round 31-32**: The opponent lost, and they switched from scissors to rock, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

33. **Round 32-33**: A tie occurred, and the opponent switched from rock to paper, which does not align with the strategy where after a tie, they play the same move.

34. **Round 33-34**: The opponent lost, and they switched from paper to scissors, which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

Based on the analysis, the opponent seems to follow a strategy where after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move. However, their behavior after ties is inconsistent, and they do not always repeat their move after a tie. The strategy that best fits their behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing 'rock', the opponent might not change their strategy. However, if they adapt, they might play 'paper' to counter my 'rock' from the last round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's potential play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.6989676948928285, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 35: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves are: paper, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, rock, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper.
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie (rounds 0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 13, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 29, 33, 34), the opponent's next move is not consistent with any single pattern.
   - After a win (rounds 5, 24, 30), the opponent's next move is not consistent with any single pattern.
   - After a loss (rounds 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 25, 27, 28, 31, 32, 35), the opponent's next move is not consistent with any single pattern.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently follow a simple pattern like playing the move that beats or loses to their last move or my last move.
   - The opponent's moves seem to depend on both the previous outcome and the previous transition, which aligns with the most complex strategy described.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the strategy that best fits the observed behavior is the most complex one, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played scissors and won against the opponent's paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (paper vs. scissors), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my best counter move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played 'rock', resulting in a tie. According to their strategy, they will play 'paper' next, as it beats 'rock'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play the move that would lose to 'paper', which is 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move is 'paper' to ensure a win.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.38264608666485866, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Analyzing the Opponent's Moves:**
   - The opponent has played 'paper' in the last round, and it was a tie.
   - Before that, the opponent played 'rock' against my 'rock', resulting in a tie.
   - Before that, the opponent played 'scissors' against my 'rock', resulting in a loss for them.
   - Before that, the opponent played 'rock' against my 'scissors', resulting in a win for them.

2. **Checking for Patterns:**
   - After a tie (round 43), the opponent played 'paper', which is the same move as the previous round (round 42).
   - After a win (round 41), the opponent played 'rock', which is the same move as the previous round (round 40).
   - After a loss (round 39), the opponent played 'scissors', which would beat their last round's move (rock).

3. **Matching with Strategies:**
   - The opponent seems to play the same move after a tie.
   - The opponent seems to play the same move after a win.
   - The opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss.

This pattern matches the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

However, the opponent's move after a tie in round 43 was the same as the previous move, which suggests a slight deviation. Despite this, the overall pattern aligns most closely with the strategy mentioned above.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both my opponent and I played paper, resulting in a tie. According to my previous guess about their strategy, after a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played paper last round, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round, my best counter-move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move, and their last move was 'scissors', I predict their next play will be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.09749658246578075, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 44: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves in the last few rounds were: scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors.
   - They played scissors after I played paper in rounds 44 and 45, both resulting in losses for me.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 24 where they played paper and won against my rock), they played scissors in the next round (round 25).
   - After a loss (e.g., round 6 where they played rock and lost to my paper), they played scissors in the next round (round 7).
   - After a tie (e.g., round 0 where both played paper), they played scissors in the next round (round 1).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play scissors frequently after both wins and losses, and sometimes after ties.
   - This behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Given this analysis, the opponent's behavior is most consistent with the strategy where they change their move based on the outcome of the previous round, specifically playing the move that would beat their last move after a win, lose to their last move after a loss, and repeat their last move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round to beat their last move, which was scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {44: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.363, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played "scissors" for the last three rounds, which beat my "paper" in each of those rounds.
   - Before these rounds, the opponent's moves varied, including "rock," "paper," and "scissors."

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win (e.g., round 5, 24, 30), the opponent's next move doesn't consistently follow a pattern of repeating the winning move or choosing a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 2, 6, 8), the opponent's next move doesn't consistently follow a pattern of choosing a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 0, 1, 3), the opponent's next move doesn't consistently follow a pattern of repeating the same move or choosing a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's recent behavior of consistently playing "scissors" suggests a strategy that doesn't change based on wins, losses, or ties.
   - The opponent's moves don't seem to be influenced by my last move or the outcome of the previous round.

Considering these observations, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the strategy where they play the same move as their opponent's last round move. This is because they have consistently played "scissors" after I played "paper," which matches the pattern of repeating my last move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and since I last played 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by my opponent, my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {44: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.5541, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played scissors in the last four rounds, resulting in ties and wins for them.
   - When the opponent won (e.g., round 5, 24, 30, 44, 45, 46), they played scissors in the next round.
   - When the opponent tied (e.g., round 0, 1, 3, 4, 9, 13, 16, 20, 21, 22, 23, 29, 33, 34, 36, 43, 47), they often repeated the same move or switched to a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat the same move (e.g., after winning with scissors, they play scissors again).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the repetition of scissors after wins and the occasional switch to a losing move after ties.

Given this analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the following strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to play paper next, as paper loses to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {44: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.08787000000000006, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are some patterns. For instance, when I played 'scissors' in round 48 and lost to their 'rock', they played 'rock' again in round 48.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 48), the opponent played 'rock' again, which suggests they might repeat their winning move.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 5), the opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'rock', which would beat their previous move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 0), the opponent repeated the same move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and repeat the same move after a tie.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- **After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.**
- **After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.**
- **After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.**

This strategy explains the observed moves accurately. Therefore, the selected strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Top hypotheses: {44: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.361509, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 49: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 48: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Identify Patterns:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays of 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors' don't seem to follow a simple pattern of always playing the move that beats or loses to their last move.
   - The opponent's moves don't consistently match my previous move either.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move sometimes (e.g., round 5 to 6, where they played 'scissors' after winning with 'scissors').
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 44 to 45, where they played 'scissors' after losing with 'scissors').
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 0 to 1, where they played 'scissors' after tying with 'paper').

3. **Strategy Evaluation:**
   - The opponent's behavior doesn't strictly follow a single simple strategy like always beating or losing to their last move.
   - The opponent's behavior seems to change based on the outcome of the previous round, indicating a more complex strategy.
   - The strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the transition made by the opponent seems to fit well, as it accounts for the variability in their responses after wins, losses, and ties.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the opponent's varied responses after different outcomes and transitions.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'paper' and won against the opponent's 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.0784562506150237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves don't consistently beat, lose to, or match my previous moves. For example, in round 5, they played scissors after I played paper, which beat my move. However, in round 6, they played rock after I played paper, which lost to my move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 2 to 3: rock to rock) and sometimes changes (e.g., round 6 to 7: rock to scissors).
   - After a loss, they sometimes play the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 5 to 6: scissors to rock) and sometimes repeat (e.g., round 24 to 25: paper to paper).
   - After a tie, they sometimes play the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 1 to 2: scissors to paper) and sometimes repeat (e.g., round 3 to 4: scissors to rock).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be influenced by the outcome of the previous round, but not in a straightforward manner. The strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the transition seems to fit best. For example:
     - After a tie in round 50 (scissors vs. scissors), the opponent played scissors again in round 51, which matches the strategy where they play the same move after a tie if they previously played the same move as two rounds ago.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the complex strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the transition:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter-move is to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary without a clear pattern of repeating or directly countering my last move. For example, when I played 'paper' and won against their 'rock', they didn't consistently switch to 'scissors' to counter 'paper' in the next round.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent doesn't consistently play the same move or a move that would beat their last move. For example, after losing with 'rock' against my 'paper', they sometimes switch to 'scissors' (which beats 'paper') but not always.
   - After a tie, the opponent's response doesn't consistently follow a pattern of playing the same move or a move that would lose to their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move, but this is not consistent enough to be a definitive pattern.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior doesn't consistently match any single strategy from the list provided. However, the strategy that involves a complex transition based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to capture the variability in their moves. This strategy accounts for different responses based on whether the opponent won, lost, or tied, and also considers the move they played two rounds ago.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's moves, the strategy that best explains their behavior is the one that involves transitions based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy allows for a more nuanced response pattern that fits the observed data.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and won against the opponent's rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'}.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.5484435628013616, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent has played 'scissors' in the last round (round 52) and 'scissors' again in round 53, resulting in a tie. This suggests they might repeat moves after a tie.
   - In rounds where I played 'rock' and they played 'scissors' (e.g., round 12), they lost and then switched to 'rock' in the next round (round 13), which would beat their previous move.
   - In rounds where I played 'scissors' and they played 'rock' (e.g., round 48), they won and repeated 'rock' in the next round (round 49).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, they seem to repeat their move (e.g., rounds 48 and 49).
   - After a loss, they switch to a move that would beat their previous move (e.g., rounds 12 and 13).
   - After a tie, they seem to repeat their move (e.g., rounds 52 and 53).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy best explains the opponent's behavior so far, as it accounts for their tendency to repeat moves after wins and ties, and switch to a move that beats their previous move after a loss.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both played 'scissors', so the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that beats or loses to their previous move.
   - For example, in round 53, they played 'rock' after playing 'scissors' in round 52, which could indicate a pattern of playing the move that beats their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 53, opponent played 'rock' and won), they played 'rock' again in the next round (round 54), which suggests they might repeat the winning move.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 48, opponent played 'rock' and won, then played 'rock' again in round 49), they might switch to a move that beats their last move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 52, opponent played 'scissors' and tied, then played 'rock' in round 53), they might switch to a move that beats their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they repeat the winning move after a win, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and switch to a move that beats their last move after a tie.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In round 53, the opponent won with 'rock'. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Identify Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays of 'paper' (which beats 'rock') often result in them playing 'rock' again, which suggests they might be repeating their move after a loss.
   - When I play 'scissors' and win against 'paper', the opponent sometimes switches to 'rock', which beats 'scissors'.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, but other times they switch to a move that would beat my last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat my last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Evaluation:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they adjust their move based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the observed behavior where the opponent often switches to a move that would beat my last move after a loss and sometimes repeats their move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it would lose to 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.4251161420408671, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 55: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays after each round seem to vary, but there might be a pattern based on the outcome of the previous round (win, lose, tie).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 10 to 11, both wins with 'paper' against 'rock').
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 24 to 25, loss with 'rock' against 'paper', then plays 'scissors' which beats 'paper').
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 9 to 10, tie with 'rock', then plays 'scissors' which loses to 'rock').

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior:
     - After wins, the opponent often repeats their move.
     - After losses, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
     - After ties, the opponent often switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves after each round need to be examined to see if they follow a consistent pattern.
   - We should check if they tend to repeat moves, counter my last move, or follow a specific pattern based on the outcome (win, lose, tie).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, loss, or tie, does the opponent's behavior change?
   - We need to see if there is a consistent response to each type of outcome.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - We will compare the opponent's moves to each of the provided strategies to see which one aligns most closely with their observed behavior.

**Analysis of the Opponent's Moves:**

- **Rounds 7-9:** 
  - Opponent plays 'scissors', 'paper', 'rock'. This sequence could suggest they are trying to beat their last move ('scissors' beats 'paper', 'paper' beats 'rock').

- **Rounds 10-12:**
  - Opponent plays 'paper', 'rock', 'scissors'. Again, this could suggest they are trying to beat their last move.

- **Rounds 13-15:**
  - Opponent plays 'paper', 'rock', 'scissors'. This pattern continues.

- **Rounds 16-18:**
  - Opponent plays 'scissors', 'rock', 'scissors'. This breaks the previous pattern, suggesting a possible change in strategy.

- **Rounds 19-21:**
  - Opponent plays 'paper', 'scissors', 'rock'. This could suggest they are trying to beat their last move again.

- **Rounds 22-24:**
  - Opponent plays 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors'. This pattern continues.

- **Rounds 25-27:**
  - Opponent plays 'paper', 'rock', 'scissors'. This pattern continues.

- **Rounds 28-30:**
  - Opponent plays 'rock', 'scissors', 'paper'. This breaks the pattern.

- **Rounds 31-33:**
  - Opponent plays 'scissors', 'rock', 'scissors'. This suggests a possible change in strategy.

- **Rounds 34-36:**
  - Opponent plays 'rock', 'scissors', 'rock'. This suggests a possible change in strategy.

- **Rounds 37-39:**
  - Opponent plays 'scissors', 'rock', 'scissors'. This suggests a possible change in strategy.

- **Rounds 40-42:**
  - Opponent plays 'paper', 'rock', 'scissors'. This pattern continues.

- **Rounds 43-45:**
  - Opponent plays 'paper', 'scissors', 'scissors'. This suggests a possible change in strategy.

- **Rounds 46-48:**
  - Opponent plays 'scissors', 'rock', 'rock'. This suggests a possible change in strategy.

- **Rounds 49-51:**
  - Opponent plays 'rock', 'scissors', 'scissors'. This suggests a possible change in strategy.

- **Rounds 52-54:**
  - Opponent plays 'rock', 'scissors', 'rock'. This suggests a possible change in strategy.

- **Rounds 55-57:**
  - Opponent plays 'scissors', 'rock', 'paper'. This suggests a possible change in strategy.

**Conclusion:**
The opponent's behavior seems to align most closely with the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move. This is because they frequently play a move that would beat their previous move, suggesting they are trying to counter their own last move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move, and their last move was 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'scissors' to beat 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent's likely next play is 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play paper next, as it would lose to their previous move, scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8028148367200174, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the potential strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response:**
   - The opponent's moves after ties, wins, and losses should be examined to see if there's a consistent pattern.
   - In the recent rounds, the opponent has played 'paper' after a tie (round 59), 'scissors' after a win (round 58), and 'scissors' after a win (round 57).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome:**
   - After a tie (round 59), the opponent played 'paper' again, which matches the strategy where after a tie, the opponent plays the same move.
   - After a win (round 58), the opponent played 'scissors', which matches the strategy where after a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (since they played 'scissors' after winning with 'scissors' against 'paper').
   - After a win (round 57), the opponent played 'scissors' again, which matches the strategy where after a win, the opponent plays the same move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that seems to fit the observed behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round ended in a tie with both playing 'paper', I predict the opponent will play 'paper' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted 'paper' play, I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move

After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays have been varied, but there are some patterns in their responses to specific outcomes (win, lose, tie).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win: The opponent often repeats their move or plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss: The opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie: The opponent often plays the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior well.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after winning, switch to a winning move after losing, and switch to a losing move after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the following strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both played scissors, resulting in a tie. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper next, as it would lose to their last move, scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves after each round need to be analyzed to see if they follow a consistent pattern based on their previous move or the outcome of the round.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - We need to check if the opponent's behavior changes after a win, loss, or tie. This involves observing if they repeat their move, switch to a move that beats or loses to their last move, or mimic our last move.

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - Compare the observed behavior with the given strategies to find the best match.

**Step-by-Step Analysis**:

- **Round 60 to 61**: 
  - Round 60: Opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a tie.
  - Round 61: Opponent played 'rock', which beats 'scissors'.
  - This suggests that after a tie, the opponent played the move that would beat their last move.

- **Round 59 to 60**:
  - Round 59: Opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie.
  - Round 60: Opponent played 'scissors', which beats 'paper'.
  - This suggests that after a tie, the opponent played the move that would beat their last move.

- **Round 58 to 59**:
  - Round 58: Opponent played 'paper', resulting in a loss.
  - Round 59: Opponent played 'paper' again.
  - This suggests that after a loss, the opponent repeated their move.

- **Round 57 to 58**:
  - Round 57: Opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a loss.
  - Round 58: Opponent played 'paper', which loses to 'scissors'.
  - This suggests that after a loss, the opponent played the move that would lose to their last move.

- **Round 56 to 57**:
  - Round 56: Opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie.
  - Round 57: Opponent played 'scissors', which beats 'paper'.
  - This suggests that after a tie, the opponent played the move that would beat their last move.

From the analysis, the opponent seems to follow a pattern where:
- After a win, they might repeat the move or play the move that beats their last move.
- After a loss, they might repeat the move or play the move that loses to their last move.
- After a tie, they play the move that beats their last move.

This pattern aligns with the strategy:
- "After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
- "After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
- "After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Therefore, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent\'s move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent\'s move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent\'s move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent\'s move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent\'s move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent\'s move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter-move is 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent has played 'rock' in the last two rounds after I played 'scissors'. This resulted in losses for me both times.
   - Looking at the history, the opponent seems to repeat moves that have previously resulted in a win for them. For example, after winning with 'rock' against my 'scissors', they played 'rock' again.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat the winning move. For instance, after winning with 'rock' against my 'scissors', they played 'rock' again.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes repeat the same move.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat my last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat winning moves and switch to counter my moves after a loss. It also accounts for the less predictable behavior after ties.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Observing the interaction history, the opponent has shown a tendency to play rock after losing to paper. Given that I played paper in the last round and won, it is likely that the opponent will play rock again in the next round to counter my paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - For example, in round 64, the opponent played 'scissors' after I played 'paper' and they won. In round 63, they played 'rock' after I played 'paper' and they lost.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last round's move. For example, in round 64, after winning with 'scissors' against my 'paper', they would likely play 'rock' next to beat 'scissors'.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. For example, in round 63, after losing with 'rock' against my 'paper', they would play 'scissors' next to lose to 'rock'.
   - After a tie, the opponent seems to play the same move as they did in the last round. For example, in round 56, after a tie with 'paper' against 'paper', they played 'rock' in the next round.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy accurately predicts the opponent's observed moves based on the outcomes of the previous rounds.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played scissors and won. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent has consistently played scissors in the last three rounds (rounds 63, 64, and 65) when I played paper. This resulted in them winning the last two rounds and losing one round before that.
   - When I played rock in round 55, they played scissors, which I won.
   - When I played scissors in round 58, they played paper, which I won.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After winning in round 64 (opponent played scissors, I played paper), they repeated the same move (scissors) in round 65.
   - After losing in round 63 (opponent played rock, I played paper), they switched to scissors in round 64, which beats paper.
   - After ties, such as in round 60 (both played scissors), they repeated the same move (scissors) in the next round (round 61).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after winning, as seen in rounds 64 and 65.
   - After a loss, they switch to a move that beats their previous move, as seen from round 63 to 64.
   - After a tie, they tend to repeat the same move, as seen from round 60 to 61.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy aligns with the following description:
- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

This strategy is consistent with the observed behavior in the interaction history.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after winning the last round with scissors, they are likely to play the same move again, which is scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent seems to have a pattern of playing moves that counter my previous plays, especially after I win. For instance, when I played 'rock' and won, they played 'paper' next, which beats 'rock'.
   - After I played 'scissors' and won, they often played 'rock' next, which beats 'scissors'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent tends to play a move that would beat my last move. For example, after I won with 'scissors' against 'paper', they played 'rock' next.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move. For instance, when they lost with 'scissors' against my 'rock', they played 'paper' next.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes repeat the same move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits these observations is: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to counter my winning moves and adjust their strategy based on the outcome of the previous round.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous move of 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent played 'paper' in the last two rounds when I played 'rock', resulting in losses for me. This suggests they might be playing a move that beats my last move.
   - In rounds 44, 45, and 46, the opponent played 'scissors' repeatedly, which beat my 'paper'. This indicates a possible pattern of sticking to a winning move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome:**
   - After winning (e.g., round 24, 30, 66, 67), the opponent tends to play the move that would beat my last move, suggesting they might be sticking to a winning strategy.
   - After ties (e.g., rounds 20, 21, 22, 23), the opponent's behavior doesn't show a clear pattern of changing moves.
   - After losses (e.g., round 18, 19), the opponent's behavior is not consistent enough to determine a pattern.

3. **Strategy Comparison:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit some of the observed behavior, but not consistently.
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move" aligns with the opponent's behavior in the last few rounds, where they played 'paper' against my 'rock'.

Given the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and since I last played rock, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

     - Round 57: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won).
     - Round 58: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won).
     - Round 59: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie).
     - Round 60: I played scissors, opponent played scissors (tie).
     - Round 61: I played scissors, opponent played rock (opponent won).
     - Round 62: I played scissors, opponent played rock (opponent won).
     - Round 63: I played paper, opponent played rock (I won).
     - Round 64: I played paper, opponent played scissors (opponent won).
     - Round 65: I played paper, opponent played scissors (opponent won).
     - Round 66: I played rock, opponent played paper (opponent won).
     - Round 67: I played rock, opponent played paper (opponent won).
     - Round 68: I played scissors, opponent played paper (I won).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move or plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous 'paper' move.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history and the provided strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 24 to 25: opponent played paper, won, and then played paper again).
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their previous move (e.g., round 30 to 31: opponent played paper, lost, and then played paper again).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 22 to 23: opponent played rock, tied, and then played paper).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

This strategy explains the observed behavior most accurately, as it accounts for the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and switch to a losing move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to play scissors next, as it loses to rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves after ties, wins, and losses need to be examined to identify any consistent patterns.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:

   - **Losses**:
     - Round 25: Win (Scissors vs. Paper) -> Next move: Rock (move that would beat Scissors)
     - Round 27: Win (Scissors vs. Paper) -> Next move: Paper (move that would beat Scissors)
     - Round 28: Win (Paper vs. Rock) -> Next move: Scissors (move that would beat Paper)

     - Round 57: Win (Rock vs. Scissors) -> Next move: Scissors (move that would beat Rock)
     - Round 58: Win (Scissors vs. Paper) -> Next move: Paper (move that would beat Scissors)
     - Round 63: Win (Paper vs. Rock) -> Next move: Paper (same move)
     - Round 68: Win (Scissors vs. Paper) -> Next move: Rock (move that would beat Scissors)
     - Round 71: Win (Scissors vs. Paper) -> Next move: Rock (move that would beat Scissors)

3. **Strategy Evaluation**:
   - The opponent seems to play the move that would lose to their last round's move after a tie.
   - After a win, they often play the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a loss, they often play the move that would beat their last round's move.

The strategy that best fits this behavior is:
- After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

Therefore, the opponent's strategy can be described as:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Top hypotheses: {54: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.4971310753170681, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.46235100000000007, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 57: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.11789108910000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent has played 'paper' against my 'rock' multiple times, resulting in losses for me.
   - The opponent has played 'scissors' against my 'paper' multiple times, resulting in losses for me.
   - The opponent has played 'rock' against my 'scissors' multiple times, resulting in losses for me.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After winning (e.g., opponent plays 'paper' against my 'rock'), the opponent often repeats the same move or plays a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After losing (e.g., opponent plays 'scissors' against my 'rock'), the opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After ties, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes repeat the same move.

3. **Strategy Comparison:**
   - "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move" seems to fit well, as the opponent often plays a move that beats their previous move.
   - "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" also fits, as the opponent repeats moves after wins and switches to a winning move after losses.

Given the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, their likely play in the next round is 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }
            ```

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {54: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.6479917527219476, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.6236457000000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 74: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they adjust their move based on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically, they often repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and sometimes switch to a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- **After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.**

This strategy accounts for the observed patterns in the opponent's responses to wins, losses, and ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.815586393, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played 'scissors' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves after each round need to be examined to see if they follow a consistent pattern.
   - We should check if the opponent's moves are based on their previous move, my previous move, or the outcome of the previous round.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, loss, or tie, does the opponent change their strategy?
   - We need to see if the opponent repeats their move, chooses a move that would beat or lose to their previous move, or mirrors my previous move.

3. **Strategy Matching:**
   - We need to match the observed behavior to the given strategies.

Let's analyze the recent rounds:

- **Round 78:** Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'rock', I won.
- **Round 79:** Opponent played 'rock', I played 'scissors', opponent won.

From this, we can observe:
- After losing in round 78, the opponent played 'rock' in round 79, which beats 'scissors'.
- After winning in round 79, the opponent might continue with 'rock' or switch based on their strategy.

Let's consider the strategies:

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent played 'rock' after 'scissors', which doesn't beat 'scissors'.

- **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent played 'rock' after 'scissors', which doesn't lose to 'scissors'.

- **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - This fits as the opponent played 'rock' after I played 'scissors', which beats 'scissors'.

- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent didn't play 'scissors' after I played 'scissors'.

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent didn't play the same move after winning.

- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent didn't play a move that would beat their last move after winning.

- **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
  - This strategy is complex and doesn't fit the simple pattern observed.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior in recent rounds aligns most closely with **Strategy 3**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move, and I played 'scissors' last, I predict their next play will be 'rock' to beat my 'scissors'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they play the move that would beat their last move or lose to their last move. For example, in round 44, they played scissors after playing paper in round 43, which would beat their previous move. However, in round 45, they played scissors again, which would lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 44 after winning in round 43) or plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 44 after winning in round 43).
   - After a loss, they sometimes play the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 48 after losing in round 47).
   - After a tie, they sometimes play the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 47 after tying in round 46).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This is evident in how they sometimes repeat moves after wins, change moves after losses, and vary their moves after ties.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the complex strategy where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the variability in their responses after wins, losses, and ties, as well as the specific transitions they make.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played rock against my paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played rock last, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 32 to 33, round 35 to 36).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 44 to 45, round 48 to 49).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 33 to 34, round 60 to 61).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the repetition after wins, the switch to a winning move after losses, and the switch to a losing move after ties.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and switch to a losing move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played scissors, resulting in a tie. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round, as paper would lose to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter-move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.772503923550057, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played 'scissors' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that my last play was 'scissors', the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9732353141017406, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9732353141017406, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and since I last played scissors, their likely next play is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper.

            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9968511614687556, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9968511614687556, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I played 'scissors' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat my 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9989199483837832, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I last played scissors, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to beat my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9996295422956376, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9996295422956376, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I played scissors last, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to beat my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves after each round are crucial in identifying their strategy. We need to see if there's a consistent pattern in how they respond to our moves.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - We should check if the opponent's behavior changes after wins, losses, or ties. This can help us narrow down the strategies.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - We will compare the opponent's actual moves with the predictions of each strategy.

- **Round 102-103:** Opponent played 'scissors' then 'scissors'. This fits the strategy where they play the same move as their last round.

Based on the analysis, the opponent seems to be following a strategy where they often play the move that would beat their last round's move, but they also sometimes repeat their last move or play the move that would lose to their last round's move. This suggests a mixed strategy, but the most consistent pattern is playing the move that would beat their last round's move.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move, and their last move was scissors, I believe their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.5799110531051827, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 104: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits the observed behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 55 to 104, the opponent's moves seem to vary without a clear pattern of repeating the same move or consistently countering my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 56: paper after a tie, round 57: scissors after a loss).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 61: rock after losing with scissors).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 56: paper after a tie).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they change their move based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior.

Given the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Top hypotheses: {104: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 105: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.10593773717362792, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move after a win or change their move after a loss.
   - For example, in round 104, the opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. In round 105, they played 'paper', which would beat 'rock', indicating a change after a loss.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move, as seen in rounds 58 and 59, where they played 'paper' after winning with 'paper'.
   - After a loss, they tend to switch to a move that would beat their previous move, as seen in rounds 104 and 105.
   - After a tie, the behavior is less clear, but they sometimes repeat the same move, as seen in rounds 60 and 61.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the repetition after wins and the change after losses.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.37415641602153954, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 104: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.05700000000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 64: {'value': 0.02752010490000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's move after a tie (round 106) was the same as their previous move (rock). This could suggest they might repeat their move after a tie.
   - In rounds where I won (e.g., round 57, 58), the opponent's subsequent move was not consistent with a single pattern, as they played both winning and losing moves.
   - In rounds where I lost (e.g., round 61, 62), the opponent's subsequent move was also inconsistent, sometimes repeating their move or changing it.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeated their move (e.g., round 61 to 62) or changed it (e.g., round 58 to 59).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes played the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 64 to 65) or repeated their move (e.g., round 66 to 67).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeated their move (e.g., round 106 to 107).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently align with any single strategy. However, the strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to capture some of the observed behaviors, especially the varied responses after wins, losses, and ties.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the strategy that best fits their behavior is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy allows for different responses based on the combination of the last outcome and the transition made, which aligns with the observed inconsistencies.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played 'rock', resulting in a tie. According to my understanding of the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Since the opponent played 'rock' in the last round, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round, I should play 'scissors' to counter their move and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.
   - There are sequences where the opponent plays the same move as their previous round, especially after a win.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., rounds 59-60, 103-104).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., rounds 61-62, 64-65).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move (e.g., rounds 69-70, 72-73).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior after a win, loss, or tie suggests they might be following a pattern based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to align well with the observed behavior.

Given the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous 'paper' move.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.6933366438505544, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 64: {'value': 0.10348485140100006, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to repeat moves or switch based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a tie (e.g., rounds 69-70, 72-73, 75-76, 106-107).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their previous move (e.g., rounds 61-62, 64-65, 66-67).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 63-64, 68-69).
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their previous move (e.g., rounds 61-62, 64-65, 66-67).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their previous move (e.g., rounds 69-70, 72-73, 75-76, 106-107).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they switch based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - Specifically, after a win, they might repeat their move or switch to a move that would beat their last move. After a loss, they switch to a move that would beat their previous move. After a tie, they might repeat their move or switch to a move that would lose to their previous move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock', so they will likely play 'scissors' next.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.785335650695388, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that my last play was 'rock', the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I played 'scissors' last, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and since I last played scissors, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to beat my scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that my last play was scissors, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie (e.g., rounds 81, 103, 122), the opponent seems to play the same move again or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.
   - After a win (e.g., rounds 74, 76, 77), the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss (e.g., rounds 79, 82, 109), the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move or repeats the same move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior after ties, wins, and losses suggests a complex strategy that involves both the outcome of the previous round and the transition they made. This aligns with the last strategy described, which considers both the previous outcome and the transition made by the opponent.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the one where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This strategy accounts for the observed variations in their moves after different outcomes.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter their move and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's last move was 'scissors' after I played 'paper' in round 123, which resulted in a loss for me.
   - In round 122, the opponent played 'scissors' after I played 'scissors', resulting in a tie.
   - In round 121, the opponent played 'scissors' after I played 'rock', resulting in a win for me.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie in round 122, the opponent played 'scissors' again in round 123.
   - After a win in round 121, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 122.
   - After a loss in round 109, the opponent switched from 'paper' to 'scissors' in round 110.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit as the opponent repeated 'scissors' after a tie in round 122.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit as the opponent repeated 'scissors' after a tie in round 122.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit as the opponent repeated 'scissors' after a tie in round 122.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit as the opponent didn't play 'paper' after I played 'paper' in round 123.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move; after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move; after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit as the opponent repeated 'scissors' after a tie in round 122.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move; after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move; after a tie, they play the same move.
     - This strategy fits well: after a win in round 121, the opponent played 'scissors' (same move) in round 122; after a tie in round 122, they played 'scissors' again in round 123.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with Strategy 6. Therefore, the selected strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next, as it beats their last move, scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent frequently plays "rock" and loses to "paper" (my play) multiple times, suggesting they might not be adapting quickly to my winning strategy.
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently beat or lose to their previous move, nor do they consistently mirror my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome:**
   - After a loss (e.g., round 109 where they played "paper" and lost to my "rock"), they did not switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a win, they do not consistently repeat their winning move or switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After ties, their behavior does not consistently follow a pattern of playing the same move or a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not fit the strategy of playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move.
   - They do not consistently play the move that would beat or lose to my last move.
   - The opponent does not seem to follow a simple pattern based on the outcome of the previous round (win, lose, tie).

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's moves, the most fitting strategy is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition the opponent made. This strategy accounts for the lack of a simple pattern and the variability observed in the opponent's moves.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and won against the opponent's rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played rock, which loses to my paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, I should play scissors to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided interaction history and the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's move in the last round was 'rock', which beat my 'scissors'. In the previous round (round 124), they played 'rock' against my 'paper', which they lost to. This suggests they repeated their move after a loss.
   - In round 123, the opponent played 'scissors' against my 'paper', which they won. In round 124, they played 'rock', which would beat their previous move 'scissors'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (round 123), the opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'rock', which would beat their previous move 'scissors'.
   - After a loss (round 124), the opponent repeated the move 'rock'.
   - After a tie (round 122), the opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'scissors', which is the same move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last move after a win.
   - After a loss, they seem to repeat the same move.
   - After a tie, they seem to play the same move.

The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Let's output this strategy in the required format:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played scissors and lost to the opponent's rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, since they played rock and won, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's plays in the last few rounds were:
     - Round 125: Opponent played 'rock' (I played 'scissors', I lost)
     - Round 126: Opponent played 'rock' (I played 'scissors', I lost)
   - The opponent repeated 'rock' after winning against my 'scissors'.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome:**
   - After winning in round 125, the opponent repeated the same move ('rock') in round 126.
   - This suggests that after a win, the opponent might repeat their move.

3. **Strategy Comparison:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit as the opponent repeated 'rock' after winning.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit as the opponent repeated 'rock' after winning.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit as the opponent repeated 'rock' after winning.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit as the opponent didn't play 'scissors' after I played 'scissors'.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This fits as the opponent repeated 'rock' after winning.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
     - This doesn't fit as the opponent didn't change their move after winning.
   - **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and transition.
     - This is too complex for the observed behavior.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns best with Strategy 5: After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', their likely play in the next round is 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent has played 'rock' frequently, especially when I played 'paper' and won.
   - The opponent's move often seems to be 'rock' after I win with 'paper'.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After I win with 'paper' against 'rock', the opponent often continues to play 'rock'.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to play 'rock' again, which suggests they might not be adapting based on the outcome.
   - After ties, there is not enough data to determine a clear pattern.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit because the opponent often repeats 'rock' even after losing.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't seem to play moves that would lose to their previous move.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit because the opponent often repeats 'rock' even when it doesn't beat my last move.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't consistently mirror my last move.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit because the opponent often repeats 'rock' after losses.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
     - This doesn't fit as the opponent doesn't change their move after losses or ties.
   - **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made.
     - This strategy is complex and doesn't seem to fit the observed behavior, as the opponent often repeats 'rock'.

Given the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to be closest to a strategy where they don't adapt based on the outcome and often repeat 'rock'. However, none of the provided strategies perfectly match this behavior. The closest match is the strategy where the opponent plays the same move after a win, but this doesn't account for their behavior after losses or ties.

Since none of the strategies perfectly fit, I'll choose the one that most closely resembles the observed behavior, which is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and won against their rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played rock last, they are likely to play paper next to beat my paper.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.478463906358224, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves after ties, wins, and losses need to be examined to identify any consistent patterns.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a tie, the opponent played scissors again (round 128). This suggests they might be repeating their move or following a pattern based on ties.
   - After a loss (round 125 and 126), the opponent played rock twice, which could suggest a pattern of repeating a move or choosing a move that beats the previous one.
   - After a win (round 124), the opponent played rock again in round 125, indicating they might repeat their move after a win.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior after a tie (round 128) suggests they might repeat their move or choose a move that would lose to their last move.
   - The opponent's behavior after a win (round 124) suggests they might repeat their move.
   - The opponent's behavior after a loss (round 125 and 126) suggests they might choose a move that beats their last move.

Considering these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both my opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to my previous guess about their strategy, after a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played scissors last, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play paper in the next round, I should play scissors to counter it and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }
            ```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior.

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves in the last few rounds have been:
     - Round 128: Opponent played 'scissors' (tie)
     - Round 129: Opponent played 'rock' (win)
   - My moves were:
     - Round 128: I played 'scissors'
     - Round 129: I played 'scissors'

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome**:
   - After a tie in round 128, the opponent played 'rock' in round 129, which beats 'scissors'. This suggests that after a tie, they might play the move that beats their last move.
   - After winning in round 129 with 'rock', we need to predict their next move. If they follow a pattern of playing the move that beats their last move after a win, they would play 'paper' next.

3. **Strategy Evaluation**:
   - Let's evaluate each strategy:
     - **Strategy 1**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
       - This strategy would predict 'paper' after 'rock' in round 129, which aligns with the current situation.
     - **Strategy 2**: The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
       - This strategy would predict 'scissors' after 'rock', which doesn't align with the observed behavior.
     - **Strategy 3**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
       - This strategy would predict 'rock' after 'scissors', which aligns with round 129 but not consistently with other rounds.
     - **Strategy 4**: The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
       - This strategy would predict 'scissors' after 'scissors', which doesn't align with round 129.
     - **Strategy 5**: After a win, the opponent plays the same move; after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move; after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
       - This strategy doesn't align with the observed behavior after ties.
     - **Strategy 6**: After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move; after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move; after a tie, they play the same move.
       - This strategy aligns with the observed behavior after wins and ties.

Based on the analysis, **Strategy 6** seems to best explain the opponent's behavior so far. They play the move that beats their last move after a win, and they play the same move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next, as it beats 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9386418001191387, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and since I last played paper, I predict their next play will be scissors to beat my paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their scissors.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - From rounds 86 to 102, the opponent consistently lost, indicating they might not be adapting effectively to my moves.
   - From rounds 103 to 135, there are a mix of ties, wins, and losses for the opponent.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - **Wins**: After the opponent wins, they seem to play a move that would beat their last move. For example, in round 109, they won with 'paper' against my 'rock', and in round 110, they played 'scissors', which beats 'paper'.
   - **Losses**: After losses, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move. For example, in round 125, they lost with 'rock' against my 'paper', and in round 126, they played 'rock' again, which would beat 'scissors'.
   - **Ties**: After ties, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move. For example, in round 106, they tied with 'rock', and in round 107, they played 'scissors', which loses to 'rock'.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.549934482058378, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - From rounds 87 to 102, the opponent consistently lost to my moves, indicating no clear pattern of adapting to my plays.
   - Starting from round 103, there are ties and losses for me, suggesting a possible change in their strategy.
   - In rounds 109 and 123, the opponent played 'paper' after I played 'rock' and 'scissors', respectively, indicating they might be trying to counter my previous move.
   - In rounds 125 and 126, the opponent played 'rock' after I played 'scissors', suggesting they might be sticking to a move that previously won.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 109), the opponent played 'paper' again in round 123, suggesting they might repeat a winning move.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 108), the opponent switched from 'rock' to 'paper' in round 109, indicating a possible change to beat my last move.
   - After ties (e.g., rounds 106 and 135), the opponent repeated the same move, suggesting they might not change their strategy after a tie.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to repeat a move after a win and change to a move that would beat my last move after a loss. After a tie, they might repeat the same move.
   - This behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie and they played paper, they are likely to play rock next, as rock loses to paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.6849541374408646, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Identify Patterns:**
   - From round 137, the opponent played 'scissors' against my 'paper', resulting in a win for them.
   - In round 136, both played 'paper', resulting in a tie.
   - In round 135, both played 'rock', resulting in a tie.
   - In round 134, the opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper', resulting in a loss for them.
   - In round 133, the opponent played 'paper' against my 'scissors', resulting in a loss for them.
   - In round 132, the opponent played 'scissors' against my 'rock', resulting in a loss for them.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win (round 137), the opponent played 'scissors'. In the previous round (136), they played 'paper', which beat my 'rock' in round 135.
   - After a tie (round 136), the opponent played 'paper', which was the same move as the previous round (135).
   - After a loss (round 134), the opponent played 'rock', which was the same move as the previous round (133).

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, they played the move that would beat their last round's move (scissors beats paper).
   - After a tie, they played the same move as the last round (paper after paper).
   - After a loss, they played the same move as the last round (rock after rock).

The strategy that best fits this pattern is:
- After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

This matches the description of the following strategy:
```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after winning the last round with scissors against my paper, they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move, which is rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'rock' last, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat my 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and given that I played 'rock' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that my last play was 'scissors', the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat my 'scissors'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9956393597348322, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I last played scissors, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to beat my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9985043003890475, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I last played scissors, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to beat my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9994869750334433, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, which suggests that they play the move that would beat my last move, and considering that my last play was scissors, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9999396431257096, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and given that I played scissors last, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9999792975921185, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'scissors' last, I predict their next play will be 'rock' to beat my 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the given strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my previous plays. For example, when I played 'paper' and they played 'scissors', they won. In the next round, they played 'scissors' again, which suggests they might be repeating their winning move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win: The opponent tends to repeat the winning move. For instance, after winning with 'scissors' against my 'paper', they played 'scissors' again.
   - After a loss: The opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move. For example, after losing with 'rock' against my 'paper', they switched to 'scissors'.
   - After a tie: The opponent's behavior is less clear, but they sometimes repeat the move or switch to a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits the observed behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat winning moves and switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss. The behavior after ties is less consistent, but this strategy still aligns with some of the observed patterns.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after winning the last round with scissors against my paper, they are likely to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves in the last few rounds are: 
     - Round 165: Opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'paper'.
     - Round 166: Opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'scissors'.
   - The opponent seems to repeat 'scissors' after losing with 'scissors'.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a loss in round 165, the opponent played 'scissors', which is the same move they played in round 165.
   - After a loss in round 166, the opponent played 'scissors' again, which is the same move they played in round 166.

3. **Strategy Comparison**:
   - The opponent plays the same move as their last move after a loss, which aligns with the strategy: "After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."
   - This behavior does not match the strategies where the opponent changes their move based on the outcome (win, loss, tie) or the move that would beat or lose to their last move.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy where they repeat their last move after a loss. Therefore, the most fitting strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.7059928990740967, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

Top hypotheses: {68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.19419502935186772, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Round 167 to 168:**
   - Round 167: Opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie.
   - Round 168: Opponent played 'paper', resulting in a win for them.

   After a tie, the opponent played the same move ('paper').

2. **Round 166 to 167:**
   - Round 166: Opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a loss.
   - Round 167: Opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie.

   After a loss, the opponent played the move that would lose to their last round's move ('scissors' to 'paper').

3. **Round 165 to 166:**
   - Round 165: Opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a win.
   - Round 166: Opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a loss.

   After a win, the opponent played the same move ('scissors').

4. **Round 164 to 165:**
   - Round 164: Opponent played 'paper', resulting in a loss.
   - Round 165: Opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a win.

   After a loss, the opponent played the move that would beat their last round's move ('paper' to 'scissors').

5. **Round 163 to 164:**
   - Round 163: Opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a loss.
   - Round 164: Opponent played 'paper', resulting in a loss.

   After a loss, the opponent played the move that would lose to their last round's move ('scissors' to 'paper').

From the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to follow this pattern:

- After a win, they play the same move.
- After a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, they play the same move.

This pattern matches the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Therefore, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's move in round 169 was 'paper', and in round 170, it was 'paper' again. This suggests they might be repeating their move after a loss.
   - In round 168, the opponent played 'paper' after playing 'paper' in round 167, which was a tie. This suggests they might repeat their move after a tie.
   - In round 167, the opponent played 'paper' after playing 'scissors' in round 166, which was a loss. This suggests they might play the move that would beat their last move after a loss.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties**:
   - After a win (round 169), the opponent played 'paper' again in round 170, suggesting they might repeat their move after a win.
   - After a loss (round 168), the opponent played 'paper' again in round 169, suggesting they might repeat their move after a loss.
   - After a tie (round 167), the opponent played 'paper' again in round 168, suggesting they might repeat their move after a tie.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move regardless of the outcome (win, loss, or tie). This aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is that they repeat their move regardless of the previous outcome.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their last move regardless of the outcome.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the same move as their last move regardless of the outcome, and their last move was 'paper', I believe their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's next play is likely to be 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.6051555643824151, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - In round 170, I played 'scissors' and the opponent played 'rock', resulting in my loss. In round 169, I played 'scissors' and the opponent played 'paper', resulting in my win. The opponent switched from 'paper' to 'rock'.
   - In round 168, I played 'rock' and the opponent played 'paper', resulting in my loss. In round 167, I played 'paper' and the opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie. The opponent switched from 'paper' to 'paper'.
   - In round 166, I played 'rock' and the opponent played 'scissors', resulting in my win. In round 165, I played 'paper' and the opponent played 'scissors', resulting in my loss. The opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'scissors'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (round 169), the opponent switched from 'paper' to 'rock'.
   - After a loss (round 168), the opponent switched from 'paper' to 'paper'.
   - After a tie (round 167), the opponent switched from 'paper' to 'paper'.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently match the strategy of playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move.
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently match the strategy of playing the move that would beat or lose to my last move.
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently match the strategy of playing the same move as my last move.
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently match the strategy of playing the same move as their last move after a win, or the move that would beat their last move after a loss, or the move that would lose to their last move after a tie.
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently match the strategy of playing the move that would beat their last move after a win, or the move that would lose to their last move after a loss, or the same move after a tie.

The opponent's behavior seems to be best explained by the complex strategy where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This strategy accounts for the observed switches in moves after different outcomes.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (which was 'paper'), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that my last move was 'scissors', the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat my 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and since I last played 'paper', the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' to beat my 'paper'.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be to play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9921926353812861, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that my last move was 'paper', the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and since I last played paper, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.
   - For example, in round 165, they played scissors after I played paper, which beat my move. In round 166, they played scissors again, which suggests they might repeat moves after a win.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 166 and 167).
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes switch to a move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 168 after a tie in round 167).
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 172 after a loss in round 171).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the repetition of moves after wins and the switch to a move that would beat their last move after losses. It also accounts for the switch to a losing move after ties.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, the opponent is likely to play rock next, as rock loses to paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - From rounds 139 to 164, the opponent consistently lost to my moves, indicating they might not have been adapting effectively.
   - Starting from round 165, the opponent's behavior changed, and they started winning or tying more frequently.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - Round 165: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors' (opponent won). Next round, opponent played 'scissors' again.
   - Round 167: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper' (tie). Next round, opponent played 'paper' again.
   - Round 168: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper' (opponent won). Next round, opponent played 'paper' again.
   - Round 170: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock' (opponent won). Next round, opponent played 'rock' again.
   - Round 171: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock' (opponent won). Next round, opponent played 'rock' again.
   - Round 187: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper' (tie). Next round, opponent played 'scissors'.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win (e.g., rounds 165-166, 168-169, 170-171).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the move (e.g., rounds 167-168) or changes to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., rounds 187-188).
   - The opponent's behavior after a loss is less clear due to fewer instances in the recent rounds.

Given this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to align most closely with:
- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This strategy is consistent with the observed behavior in the recent rounds.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and given that I played 'rock' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.7938849446764706, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played scissors in the last round, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to beat my last move.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the potential strategies listed.

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - From rounds 142 to 164, the opponent consistently lost to my moves, suggesting a predictable pattern that I exploited.
   - Starting from round 165, the opponent's behavior seems to change. They win in round 165, tie in round 167, and lose in round 168. This indicates a possible shift in strategy or adaptation.
   - In rounds 165, 167, and 191, the opponent played the same move as my last move, resulting in a tie in rounds 167 and 191.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome**:
   - After a win (round 165), the opponent played the same move (scissors) in round 166, which lost to my rock.
   - After a tie (round 167), the opponent played paper again in round 168, which beat my rock.
   - After a loss (round 168), the opponent switched to rock in round 169, which lost to my scissors.
   - After a win (round 169), the opponent switched to rock in round 170, which lost to my scissors again.
   - After a tie (round 191), the opponent played paper again in round 192, resulting in another tie.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a tie, as seen in rounds 167 and 191.
   - After a win, they sometimes repeat the move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move, as seen in rounds 165-166 and 169-170.
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would lose to their last move, as seen in rounds 168-169.

The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy:
"After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the observed behavior, particularly the repetition after ties and the inconsistent responses after wins and losses.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.4790036228914707, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to match some observed patterns.
   - However, the strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." provides a more nuanced explanation that accounts for the variability in the opponent's behavior, especially considering the transitions after different outcomes.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the last strategy seems to best fit the observed patterns. It accounts for the opponent's transitions based on both the outcome and their previous transition, which aligns with the observed variability in their moves.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played 'scissors', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move in the last round as they did two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a different one. For example, in rounds 187 and 191, the opponent played 'paper' after a tie, and in round 192, they played 'scissors' after a tie.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 172), the opponent played 'rock' again in round 173, which is consistent with repeating the winning move.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 188), the opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'rock' in round 189, which is consistent with playing the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 187), the opponent played 'paper' again in round 188, which is consistent with repeating the move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior:
     - Wins: The opponent often repeats the winning move.
     - Losses: The opponent switches to a move that would beat their last move.
     - Ties: The opponent sometimes repeats the move or switches to a losing move.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best matches the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and won against the opponent's rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played rock last round, they will likely play paper next to beat rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played 'scissors' last, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat my 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I last played scissors, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9789759169497386, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that my last play was 'paper', the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', my best move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'paper' last, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' next to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9991516024150544, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and since I last played 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'scissors' to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.3997089996283637, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 192: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.04783480379499794, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to counter my previous moves often. For example, when I played 'paper' in round 213, they played 'scissors', which beats 'paper'.
   - This suggests they might be playing the move that would beat my last round's move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning (e.g., round 213), the opponent played 'scissors' which beat my 'paper'. 
   - After losing (e.g., round 212), they played 'scissors' again, which would beat my 'paper' from round 211.
   - After ties, they seem to continue with a move that would beat my last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move" aligns well with the observed behavior. The opponent consistently plays the move that would beat my previous move, regardless of the outcome (win, lose, or tie).

Given this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move, and my last play was paper, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's last move was 'paper' after I played 'rock' in round 214, resulting in their win.
   - In round 213, the opponent played 'scissors' after I played 'paper', resulting in their win.
   - In round 212, the opponent played 'paper' after I played 'scissors', resulting in their loss.
   - In round 211, the opponent played 'rock' after I played 'rock', resulting in their loss.
   - In round 210, the opponent played 'rock' after I played 'paper', resulting in their loss.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win in round 213, the opponent played 'paper' in round 214, which would beat their previous move 'scissors'.
   - After a loss in round 212, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 213, which would beat my previous move 'paper'.
   - After a loss in round 211, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 212, which would beat my previous move 'rock'.
   - After a loss in round 210, the opponent played 'rock' in round 211, which would beat my previous move 'scissors'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last move after a win.
   - After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat my last move.
   - This pattern aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and won. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play scissors next to beat their last move, which was paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

Top hypotheses: {68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.28585740981789826, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 214: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's recent plays have been: paper, paper, paper, scissors, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper.
   - The opponent has played "paper" consistently, except for a few instances where they played "scissors."

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - The opponent seems to play "paper" frequently, regardless of the outcome. However, there are instances where they played "scissors" after a tie or a loss.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit, as the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that beats their last move.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit, as the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that loses to their last move.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit, as the opponent doesn't consistently play the move that beats my last move.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit, as the opponent doesn't consistently mirror my last move.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This partially fits, as the opponent often repeats "paper" after winning, but doesn't consistently follow the other rules.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
     - This doesn't fit, as the opponent doesn't consistently follow these rules.
   - **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
     - This strategy is complex and could potentially fit the observed behavior, as it allows for varied responses based on different conditions.

Given the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to align most closely with Strategy 7, which accounts for varied responses based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'rock' and the opponent played 'paper', resulting in my loss. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where the opponent played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (which was 'rock'), they will play the move that would beat their last move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Top hypotheses: {68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.5001001868725288, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 214: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.363, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 170: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their last move regardless of the outcome.', 'value': 0.23924286485381302, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 213 to 216, the opponent consistently played 'paper' against my 'rock', resulting in my loss. This suggests a pattern where the opponent might be playing a move that beats my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - The opponent's recent behavior (rounds 213 to 216) shows that they continued to play 'paper' after winning against my 'rock'. This could indicate a strategy where they repeat their winning move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's consistent use of 'paper' after winning suggests they might be following a strategy where they repeat their move after a win. However, this doesn't fully align with any single strategy listed.
   - Let's consider the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."
   - This strategy fits the observed pattern: after winning with 'paper', the opponent continues to play 'paper'.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after winning the last round with paper against my rock, they are likely to play the same move again, which is paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 168 to 172, the opponent played paper, paper, rock, rock, and rock. This sequence suggests a pattern where the opponent might be reacting to my moves or their own previous moves.
   - In rounds 173 to 177, the opponent played scissors, paper, rock, paper, and scissors. This sequence doesn't show a consistent pattern of repeating the same move or directly countering my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 168), the opponent played the same move (paper) in the next round (169).
   - After a loss (e.g., round 169), the opponent switched from paper to rock in round 170, which beats my last move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 192), the opponent played the same move (scissors) in the next round (193).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play the same move after a win, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and play the same move after a tie. This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Given this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to play paper next, as paper would lose to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {218: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 169 to 218, the opponent's moves seem to follow a pattern where they often play the move that would beat my last move. For example, when I played 'scissors' in round 170, they played 'rock' in round 171, which beats 'scissors'.
   - However, there are instances where this pattern doesn't hold, such as in rounds 213 to 216, where the opponent played 'scissors', 'paper', 'paper', and 'paper' consecutively.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, as seen in rounds 187 and 188, where they played 'paper' after winning with 'paper'.
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat my last move, as seen in rounds 214 to 215, where they played 'paper' after losing with 'rock'.
   - After a tie, the opponent's response seems less predictable, but they sometimes repeat their move, as seen in rounds 217 and 218, where they played 'scissors' after a tie with 'scissors'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to fit some of the observed behaviors, but not consistently.
   - The strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made" seems to account for the variability in their responses, as it considers both the outcome and the transition.

Given the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the one that considers both the previous outcome and transition. This strategy accounts for the variability and patterns observed in the opponent's moves.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played scissors and won against the opponent's paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (paper vs. scissors), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my previous moves, especially after a win or a loss.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win (e.g., rounds 172-173, 175-176, 178-179).
   - After losses, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their previous move (e.g., rounds 170-171, 188-189).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less consistent, but there are instances where they switch to a move that would lose to their previous move (e.g., round 217-218).

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior well.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win and switch to a counter-move after a loss.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played rock and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play paper in the next round to beat their previous move (rock).

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.3801740548680942, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 214: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.3472563, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 215: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to repeat moves or switch based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - When I played 'scissors' and it resulted in a tie (round 220), the opponent also played 'scissors' in the next round (round 221).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie, the opponent played the same move as in the previous round (e.g., rounds 217-218, 220-221).
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the winning move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the observed behavior, especially the response to ties and the occasional switch after wins and losses.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {215: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.34344899999999995, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 221: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 172 to 187, the opponent consistently played moves that resulted in my winning. This suggests they might have been playing a predictable pattern or a losing strategy.
   - In rounds 188 and 213, the opponent played scissors after I played paper, resulting in their win. This suggests they might be adapting or changing strategies.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 188), the opponent played scissors again in round 189, which would beat my previous paper move. This suggests they might play the move that would beat my last move after a win.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 189), the opponent played paper in round 190, which would lose to my scissors. This suggests they might play the move that would lose to their last move after a loss.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 192), the opponent played rock in round 193, which would beat my scissors. This suggests they might play the move that would beat my last move after a tie.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy where they play the move that would beat their opponent's last round move after a win or a tie, and play the move that would lose to their last move after a loss.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost, so they will likely play paper next, as paper would lose to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, I should play scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For example, after a loss, they often play a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a win, they sometimes repeat the same move or play a move that would beat their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, they often play a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, their behavior seems less predictable, but they sometimes repeat the move or play a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win and change to a winning move after a loss.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best move would be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change in response to my moves. For example, when I played 'rock' and won against their 'scissors', they switched to 'paper' in subsequent rounds where I played 'rock' again and lost.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent often plays a move that would beat their last move. For instance, when they played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock', they switched to 'paper' in the next round.
   - After a loss, they seem to play the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, their behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes repeat the same move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with a strategy where they play the move that would beat their last move after a win or a loss. This suggests they are trying to adjust their strategy based on the outcome of the previous round.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

- **After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.**
- **After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.**
- **After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less consistent, but they sometimes repeat the same move.**

This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Therefore, the best fitting strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played scissors and I played rock), they will play the move that would lose to their last round's move, which is scissors. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

Top hypotheses: {221: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.33990000000000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.2253797905738294, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's move in the last round was 'paper' after I played 'rock'. This resulted in a win for the opponent.
   - In previous rounds, when I played 'rock', the opponent played 'scissors' (rounds 176, 179, 185, 199, 202, 211, 221, 223) and 'paper' (rounds 214, 215, 216, 224).
   - The opponent seems to switch between playing 'scissors' and 'paper' when I play 'rock'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 224), the opponent played 'paper' again, which suggests they might repeat the winning move.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 223), the opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'paper', indicating a possible change in strategy.
   - After ties (e.g., rounds 217, 220), the opponent played 'scissors' again, suggesting they might repeat the move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

This strategy explains the observed behavior:
- After winning with 'paper' against 'rock', the opponent played 'paper' again.
- After losing with 'scissors' against 'rock', the opponent switched to 'paper'.
- After ties, the opponent repeated the move.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they won with 'paper'. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats the move or plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the move or plays the move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent tends to repeat their move or play the move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses:** The opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** The opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to partially fit, but it doesn't fully explain the behavior after ties.
   - The strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." is complex and considers multiple factors, which might explain the observed behavior more accurately.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the last strategy, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition, seems to best explain the opponent's behavior.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played scissors and won against the opponent's paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move or plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent tends to repeat their move or plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses:** The opponent tends to play a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** The opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, change to a winning move after a loss, and sometimes play a losing move after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played rock and I played paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I last played scissors, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to beat my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played scissors last, I predict their next play will be rock to beat my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9892782592096336, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I last played scissors, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I played 'scissors' last, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat my 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary based on the outcome of the previous round (win, lose, or tie).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes plays the same move or the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - **Wins**: The opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - **Losses**: The opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - **Ties**: The opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made.
   - This strategy accounts for the observed behavior of repeating moves after certain outcomes and changing moves based on the previous transition.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the one where the opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move in the last round as they did two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 197 to 212, the opponent consistently lost to my moves, indicating they might not be adapting based on my previous move.
   - From rounds 213 to 216, the opponent won against my moves, suggesting a change in their strategy.
   - From rounds 217 to 246, the opponent mostly lost again, with a few ties and wins.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning in rounds 213 to 216, the opponent continued with a strategy that countered my previous moves.
   - After losing in rounds 217 to 246, the opponent's behavior seemed less predictable, with a mix of losses and ties.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently follow a simple pattern like playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move.
   - The opponent's behavior after wins, losses, and ties seems to vary, suggesting a more complex strategy.
   - The strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the opponent's previous transition seems to fit best, as it allows for variability in response based on the outcome and previous moves.

Given the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the one where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This strategy accounts for the variability observed in their responses after wins, losses, and ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'paper' and won against the opponent's 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best move to counter this would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {68: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.29908528268014867, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they play moves that would beat my last move. For example, in round 250, I played 'scissors' and they played 'rock', which beats 'scissors'.
   - There are also instances where they play the same move as my last move, such as in round 245, where both played 'scissors'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move. For example, in round 201, they played 'rock' and won, and in round 202, they played 'scissors', which beats my 'rock'.
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat my last move. For example, in round 224, they lost with 'paper' against my 'rock', and in round 225, they played 'scissors', which beats 'paper'.
   - After a tie, they sometimes play the same move again. For example, in round 220, both played 'scissors', and in round 221, they played 'scissors' again.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they adjust based on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically, they seem to repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and sometimes repeat the move after a tie.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This strategy accounts for the observed patterns in their play, particularly their tendency to repeat moves after wins and adjust after losses.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my best counter move is 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 202 to 212, the opponent consistently played moves that lost to mine, suggesting a pattern.
   - From rounds 213 to 216, the opponent won or tied, indicating a possible change in strategy.
   - From rounds 217 to 251, the opponent's moves seem to be a mix of losing and tying, with occasional wins.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 213), the opponent played scissors, which beat my paper.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 214), the opponent continued with paper, which beat my rock.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 217), the opponent played paper, which lost to my scissors.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, they sometimes play a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, they sometimes play a move that would beat my last move.
   - After a tie, they sometimes play a move that would lose to their last move.

The strategy that best fits these observations is:
- "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy accounts for the observed behavior where the opponent's move changes based on the outcome of the previous round.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it would lose to their previous move 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their last move. For example, in round 251, the opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'scissors' in round 250.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win: In round 250, the opponent played 'rock' after winning with 'scissors' in round 249, suggesting they might repeat a move after a win.
   - After a loss: In round 251, the opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'scissors' in round 250, suggesting they might switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss.
   - After a tie: In round 247, the opponent played 'rock' after tying with 'scissors' in round 246, suggesting they might switch to a move that beats their last move after a tie.

3. **Most Accurate Strategy:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and switch to a move that beats their last move after a tie. This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.8821972634600526, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I last played scissors, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to beat my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played 'scissors' last, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat my 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock' and secure a win.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and since I last played scissors, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of rock, my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat my 'paper'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9952462346661425, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I last played scissors, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to beat my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played scissors last, I predict their next play will be rock to beat my scissors.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - In round 269, I played 'rock', and the opponent played 'paper', resulting in my loss. In round 268, I played 'paper', and the opponent played 'rock', resulting in my win. This suggests that the opponent might be playing the move that beats my last move, but let's verify this pattern over more rounds.
   - In round 267, I played 'scissors', and the opponent played 'paper', resulting in my win. In round 266, I played 'rock', and the opponent played 'scissors', resulting in my win. This doesn't fit the pattern of playing the move that beats my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (round 268), the opponent played 'paper' in round 269, which beats my last move 'rock'. This suggests that after a win, the opponent might play the move that beats my last move.
   - After a loss (round 267), the opponent played 'rock' in round 268, which beats my last move 'paper'. This suggests that after a loss, the opponent might play the move that beats my last move.
   - After a tie (round 265), the opponent played 'rock' in round 266, which beats my last move 'scissors'. This suggests that after a tie, the opponent might play the move that beats my last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to consistently play the move that beats my last move, regardless of whether they won, lost, or tied in the previous round. This aligns with the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move."

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played 'rock' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat my 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided interaction history and the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they play a move that would beat their previous move (e.g., from 'rock' to 'paper') or lose to their previous move (e.g., from 'scissors' to 'rock').

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 224 to 225: 'paper' to 'paper') or switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 269 to 270: 'paper' to 'scissors').
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 250 to 251: 'rock' to 'paper').
   - After a tie, they sometimes switch to a move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 227 to 228: 'scissors' to 'paper').

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior after wins, losses, and ties suggests a complex strategy that considers both the outcome and their previous move. The transitions after wins, losses, and ties align with the strategy that involves changing moves based on the previous outcome and the transition made.

Given these observations, the opponent's behavior is best explained by the strategy where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This strategy accounts for the observed patterns in their behavior.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, we need to analyze the last few rounds. In round 270, I played scissors and the opponent played paper, resulting in my win. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (round 269: opponent played paper, I played rock), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter-move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be to play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9830289162666737, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and considering that I played 'paper' last, I predict that their next play will be 'scissors' to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves are not consistently the same as my last move, nor do they consistently beat or lose to my last move. This rules out simple strategies like "play the move that would beat/lose to the opponent's last move" or "play the same move as the opponent's last move."

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move or choose a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to choose a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent seems to choose a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior well. This strategy accounts for the opponent's tendency to repeat their move after a win and change their move to beat their last move after a loss. After a tie, they seem to choose a move that would lose to their last move, which aligns with the observed pattern.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it against the possible strategies.

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays after my moves show a tendency to switch between rock, paper, and scissors, but there are instances where they repeat moves or choose moves that would lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win: The opponent often repeats the move that won or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss: The opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie: The opponent sometimes repeats the move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The opponent's behavior doesn't consistently match a simple pattern like always playing the move that beats their last move or the move that would lose to their last move.
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be more complex, possibly involving a combination of responses based on the outcome of the previous round and the transition they made.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the strategy that best fits the observed behavior is the most complex one, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition the opponent made.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper' to ensure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that my last play was 'rock', the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'rock' last, their likely play in the next round is 'paper'.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that my last play was 'rock', the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9916675917358775, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.9916675917358775, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'rock' last, their likely play in the next round is 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played scissors last, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to beat my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best move to counter this would be paper, as paper beats rock.
