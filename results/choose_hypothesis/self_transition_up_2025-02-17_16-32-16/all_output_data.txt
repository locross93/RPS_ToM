User Message: 
            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 1, {'round': 0, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}].

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }
            ```
            


            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 1, {'round': 0, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}.

            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

            }

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I won (Scissors beats Paper)

Given this single round of interaction, let's evaluate each potential strategy:

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - If this were true, the opponent would play Rock in the next round (since Rock beats Scissors, which beats Paper). However, we don't have enough data to confirm this yet.

- **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - If this were true, the opponent would play Scissors in the next round (since Scissors loses to Rock, which beats Paper). Again, we don't have enough data to confirm this yet.

- **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - If this were true, the opponent would play Rock in the next round (since Rock beats Scissors). We need more data to confirm this.

- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - If this were true, the opponent would play Scissors in the next round. We need more data to confirm this.

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - The opponent lost this round, so according to this strategy, they would play Scissors in the next round (since Scissors beats Paper). We need more data to confirm this.

- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - The opponent lost this round, so according to this strategy, they would play Rock in the next round (since Rock loses to Paper). We need more data to confirm this.

- **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
  - This strategy is too complex to determine with a single round of data.

Given the limited data, it's challenging to definitively determine the opponent's strategy. However, based on the single round, the opponent lost, and if they follow a simple pattern, they might try to play the move that would beat their last move (Strategy 5). But this is speculative without more data.

For now, I'll choose Strategy 5 as a tentative hypothesis:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, since they lost the last round, they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which was paper. Therefore, their next play is likely to be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {1: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I win

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win

Now, let's examine the possible strategies:

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - Round 0: Opponent played Paper. In Round 1, they played Scissors, which would beat Paper. This matches.
  
- **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - Round 0: Opponent played Paper. In Round 1, they played Scissors, which would not lose to Paper. This does not match.
  
- **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - Round 0: I played Scissors. In Round 1, they played Scissors, which would not beat Scissors. This does not match.
  
- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - Round 0: I played Scissors. In Round 1, they played Scissors, which matches. However, this is not consistent with Round 0.
  
- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - Round 0: Opponent lost. In Round 1, they played Scissors, which would beat their last move (Paper). This matches.
  
- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - Round 0: Opponent lost. In Round 1, they played Scissors, which would not lose to their last move (Paper). This does not match.
  
- **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on previous outcomes and transitions.
  - This strategy is too complex to match with only two rounds of data.

Based on the analysis, Strategy 1 and Strategy 5 both fit the observed behavior. However, Strategy 5 provides a more comprehensive explanation for the opponent's behavior after a loss, which is consistent with the data. Therefore, Strategy 5 is the most likely strategy.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost, so they are likely to play rock next to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best move would be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```
