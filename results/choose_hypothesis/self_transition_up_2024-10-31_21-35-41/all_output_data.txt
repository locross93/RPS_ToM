            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 1, {'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}].

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the best response to my last move
The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round
The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }
            ```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round, I believe their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Selected strategy: The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie and the opponent played paper, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
