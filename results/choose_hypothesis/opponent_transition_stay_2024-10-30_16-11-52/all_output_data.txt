            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the best response to my last move
The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move

The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 6, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}].

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the best response to my last move
The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round
The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie and they played scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the option that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, the opponent is likely to play rock next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Selected strategy: After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move

The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the best response to my last move
The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round

After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round
The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted paper play by the opponent, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',

Selected strategy: After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round

            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 6, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 7, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 9, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 10, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 11, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 12, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 13, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 14, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 15, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 16, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}].

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the best response to my last move
The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round
The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss they play the option that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it would lose to their last move 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Selected strategy: After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round

            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 6, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 7, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 9, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 10, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 11, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 12, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 13, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 14, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 15, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 16, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 17, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 18, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 19, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}].

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the best response to my last move
The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round
The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 19, {'round': 19, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 6, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 7, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 9, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 10, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 11, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 12, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 13, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 14, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 15, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 16, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 17, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 18, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 19, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}].
            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Selected strategy: After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the best response to my last move
The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round

After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round
The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie and they played paper, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Selected strategy: After a win the opponent plays the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the best response to my last move
The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round
The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the best response to my last move
The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round
The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            You last played: paper

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the option that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of rock, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Selected strategy: After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they seem to adapt their play based on the previous outcome and transition. In the last round, we both played paper resulting in a tie. Historically, after a tie, the opponent has shown a tendency to switch to scissors. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my best counter move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Selected strategy: The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win they play the option that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it beats their last move 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Selected strategy: After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the best response to my last move
The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round
The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the option that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Selected strategy: After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the best response to my last move
The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round
The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Observing the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their last play after a tie. Since the last three rounds ended in ties with both playing rock, it is likely they will continue with rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Selected strategy: The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent cycles through strategies in a fixed order, picking the option that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the best response to my last move
The opponent copies me and plays the same move as I did in the last round
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss they play the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round
The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the option that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their last move, which was 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Selected strategy: After a win the opponent plays the option that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss they play the option that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie they play the same move as they did in the last round

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the option that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, they are likely to play scissors next, as scissors would lose to rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter and win against scissors.
