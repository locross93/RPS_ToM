To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the given interaction history:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I won (3 reward)

Given this single round of data, the opponent played Scissors, which lost to my Rock.

Now, let's consider the possible strategies:

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - If this were true, the opponent would play Rock in the next round (to beat Scissors).

- **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - If this were true, the opponent would play Paper in the next round (to lose to Scissors).

- **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - If this were true, the opponent would play Paper in the next round (to beat Rock).

- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - If this were true, the opponent would play Rock in the next round.

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - The opponent lost, so they would play Rock in the next round (to beat Scissors).

- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - The opponent lost, so they would play Paper in the next round (to lose to Scissors).

- **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
  - This strategy is complex and requires more data to analyze effectively.

Based on the single round of data, the opponent played Scissors and lost. The strategies that align with this behavior are Strategy 2 and Strategy 6, where the opponent would play Paper next (to lose to Scissors).

Since we only have one round of data, it's challenging to definitively determine the opponent's strategy. However, Strategy 6 seems to be a plausible explanation given the loss condition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played scissors and lost, they are likely to play paper next, which would lose to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, I should play scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Tie

Now, let's evaluate the possible strategies:

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - Round 0: Opponent played Scissors. If they followed this strategy, they would play Rock in Round 1. They played Scissors, so this strategy doesn't fit.

- **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - Round 0: Opponent played Scissors. If they followed this strategy, they would play Paper in Round 1. They played Scissors, so this strategy doesn't fit.

- **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - Round 0: My play was Rock. If they followed this strategy, they would play Paper in Round 1. They played Scissors, so this strategy doesn't fit.

- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - Round 0: My play was Rock. If they followed this strategy, they would play Rock in Round 1. They played Scissors, so this strategy doesn't fit.

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - Round 0: Opponent lost, so they should play Rock in Round 1 to beat their last move (Scissors). They played Scissors, so this strategy doesn't fit.

- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - Round 0: Opponent lost, so they should play Paper in Round 1 to lose to their last move (Scissors). They played Scissors, so this strategy doesn't fit.

- **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
  - Round 0: Opponent lost and played Scissors, which would lose to my Rock. According to this strategy, they should play the move that would beat their last round's move (Rock) in Round 1. They played Scissors, so this strategy doesn't fit.

Based on the analysis, none of the strategies perfectly fit the opponent's behavior so far. However, the opponent repeated the same move (Scissors) after losing, which might suggest a pattern of repeating moves regardless of the outcome. This could be a variation of Strategy 4, but not exactly fitting any given strategy.

Given the lack of a perfect fit, I will choose the strategy that seems closest to the observed behavior, which is repeating the same move:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the same move as their last round\'s move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent tends to play the same move as their last round's move, and their last move was scissors, I believe their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 2: {'Opponent_strategy': "The opponent plays the same move as their last round's move.", 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Observation: The opponent played the same move as their last round's move (Scissors).

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Observation: The opponent played the move that would beat their last round's move (Scissors -> Paper).

4. **Round 3:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I win
   - Observation: The opponent played the same move as their last round's move (Paper).

Now, let's evaluate the possible strategies:

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit because in Round 3, the opponent repeated Paper instead of playing Scissors to beat Paper.

- **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit because in Round 2, the opponent played Paper, which beats Scissors.

- **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit because in Round 1, the opponent played Scissors, which doesn't beat my last move (Scissors).

- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit because in Round 2, the opponent played Paper, not Rock.

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit because in Round 1, after a tie, the opponent repeated Scissors instead of playing Rock.

- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - This doesn't fit because in Round 2, after a loss, the opponent played Paper, which beats Scissors.

- **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
  - This strategy is complex and could potentially fit the observed behavior, as it allows for different responses based on the outcome and previous transitions.

Given the observations, Strategy 7 seems to be the most plausible explanation for the opponent's behavior, as it accounts for the variability in their responses based on both the outcome and their previous transitions.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played scissors and won against the opponent's paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Tie
   - The opponent played the same move as their previous move (Scissors).

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lose
   - The opponent played the move that would beat my last move (Rock).

4. **Round 3:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I win
   - The opponent played the same move as their previous move (Paper).

5. **Round 4:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I lose
   - The opponent played the move that would beat my last move (Paper).

**Analysis:**

- **Pattern Recognition:**
  - After a tie in Round 1, the opponent repeated their move (Scissors).
  - After a loss in Round 2, the opponent played the move that would beat my last move (Rock).
  - After a win in Round 3, the opponent repeated their move (Paper).
  - After a loss in Round 4, the opponent played the move that would beat my last move (Paper).

- **Behavior Based on Outcome:**
  - It seems that after a tie, the opponent repeats their move.
  - After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat my last move.
  - After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

- **Strategy Prediction:**
  - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Based on the analysis, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next move by opponent: Scissors

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Next move by opponent: Paper

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next move by opponent: Paper

4. **Round 3:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next move by opponent: Scissors

5. **Round 4:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next move by opponent: Scissors

6. **Round 5:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next move by opponent: (to be determined)

**Analysis:**

- **Round 0 to 1:** After losing with Scissors, the opponent played Scissors again. This could align with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (Scissors beats Paper).

- **Round 1 to 2:** After a tie with Scissors, the opponent played Paper. This could align with the strategy where after a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (Paper loses to Scissors).

- **Round 2 to 3:** After winning with Paper, the opponent played Paper again. This aligns with the strategy where after a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

- **Round 3 to 4:** After losing with Paper, the opponent played Scissors. This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (Scissors beats Paper).

- **Round 4 to 5:** After winning with Scissors, the opponent played Scissors again. This aligns with the strategy where after a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

The opponent's behavior seems to align most closely with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat their previous 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: 
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next opponent play (Round 1): Scissors

2. **Round 1**:
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Next opponent play (Round 2): Paper

3. **Round 2**:
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next opponent play (Round 3): Paper

4. **Round 3**:
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next opponent play (Round 4): Scissors

5. **Round 4**:
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next opponent play (Round 5): Scissors

6. **Round 5**:
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next opponent play (Round 6): Scissors

7. **Round 6**:
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I lose

Now, let's evaluate the possible strategies:

- **Strategy 1**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent repeated "Scissors" in rounds 1, 4, 5, and 6.

- **Strategy 2**: The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent repeated "Scissors" in rounds 1, 4, 5, and 6.

- **Strategy 3**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent didn't play "Rock" after my "Scissors" in round 1.

- **Strategy 4**: The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent didn't play "Rock" after my "Rock" in round 0.

- **Strategy 5**: After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This fits well:
    - After a win in round 0, opponent played the same move (Scissors) in round 1.
    - After a tie in round 1, opponent played the move that would lose to their last move (Paper) in round 2.
    - After a loss in round 2, opponent played the move that would beat their last move (Paper) in round 3.
    - After a win in round 3, opponent played the same move (Scissors) in round 4.
    - After a loss in round 4, opponent played the move that would beat their last move (Scissors) in round 5.
    - After a win in round 5, opponent played the same move (Scissors) in round 6.

- **Strategy 6**: After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent repeated "Scissors" in rounds 1, 4, 5, and 6.

- **Strategy 7**: Complex transition strategy based on previous outcomes and transitions.
  - This is too complex for the observed pattern.

The best-fitting strategy is Strategy 5. Here's the output:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: 
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next opponent play (Round 1): Scissors

2. **Round 1**:
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Tie
   - Next opponent play (Round 2): Paper

3. **Round 2**:
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next opponent play (Round 3): Paper

4. **Round 3**:
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next opponent play (Round 4): Scissors

5. **Round 4**:
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next opponent play (Round 5): Scissors

6. **Round 5**:
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win
   - Next opponent play (Round 6): Scissors

7. **Round 6**:
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I lose
   - Next opponent play (Round 7): Scissors

8. **Round 7**:
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I win

**Analysis**:
- The opponent played "Scissors" in rounds 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7, which suggests a pattern.
- After a win (Round 0), the opponent repeated their move (Scissors in Round 1).
- After a tie (Round 1), the opponent switched to a move that would beat their last move (Scissors to Paper in Round 2).
- After a loss (Round 2), the opponent repeated their move (Paper in Round 3).
- After a win (Round 3), the opponent switched to a move that would beat their last move (Paper to Scissors in Round 4).
- After a loss (Round 4), the opponent repeated their move (Scissors in Round 5).
- After a win (Round 5), the opponent repeated their move (Scissors in Round 6).
- After a loss (Round 6), the opponent repeated their move (Scissors in Round 7).

**Conclusion**:
The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing with scissors against my rock in the last round, they are likely to play rock in the next round to beat my previous move.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 9, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 6, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 7, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}].

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Round 0 to 1:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'scissors' (tie). 
   - Possible strategies: 
     - "The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move" (since I played 'scissors' in round 1).
     - "After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

2. **Round 1 to 2:**
   - Opponent played 'paper' after playing 'scissors' (tie).
   - Possible strategies:
     - "After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

3. **Round 2 to 3:**
   - Opponent played 'paper' after playing 'paper' (win).
   - Possible strategies:
     - "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

4. **Round 3 to 4:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'paper' (loss).
   - Possible strategies:
     - "After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

5. **Round 4 to 5:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'scissors' (win).
   - Possible strategies:
     - "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

6. **Round 5 to 6:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'scissors' (loss).
   - Possible strategies:
     - "After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

7. **Round 6 to 7:**
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'scissors' (win).
   - Possible strategies:
     - "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

8. **Round 7 to 8:**
   - Opponent played 'rock' after playing 'scissors' (loss).
   - Possible strategies:
     - "After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

From the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy where after a win, they play the same move, and after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. This is consistent with the observed moves in rounds 3, 5, 6, and 8.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best move to counter this would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0 to 1**: 
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'scissors'. This could fit multiple strategies, such as playing the same move as their last move.

2. **Round 1 to 2**: 
   - Opponent played 'paper' after 'scissors'. This fits the strategy where they play the move that would beat their opponent's last move (scissors beats paper).

3. **Round 2 to 3**: 
   - Opponent played 'paper' after 'paper'. This could fit the strategy of playing the same move as their last move.

4. **Round 3 to 4**: 
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'paper'. This fits the strategy of playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move (paper beats rock).

5. **Round 4 to 5**: 
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'scissors'. This could fit the strategy of playing the same move as their last move.

6. **Round 5 to 6**: 
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'scissors'. This could fit the strategy of playing the same move as their last move.

7. **Round 6 to 7**: 
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'scissors'. This could fit the strategy of playing the same move as their last move.

8. **Round 7 to 8**: 
   - Opponent played 'rock' after 'scissors'. This fits the strategy of playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move (scissors beats paper).

9. **Round 8 to 9**: 
   - Opponent played 'paper' after 'rock'. This fits the strategy of playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move (rock beats scissors).

10. **Round 9 to 10**: 
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'paper'. This fits the strategy of playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move (paper beats rock).

11. **Round 10 to 11**: 
    - Opponent played 'rock' after 'scissors'. This fits the strategy of playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move (scissors beats paper).

12. **Round 11 to 12**: 
    - Opponent played 'paper' after 'rock'. This fits the strategy of playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move (rock beats scissors).

13. **Round 12 to 13**: 
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'paper'. This fits the strategy of playing the move that would beat their opponent's last move (paper beats rock).

From the analysis, the opponent consistently plays the move that would beat my last move. This indicates that the opponent is using the strategy:

"The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move."

Thus, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'paper' last, I predict their next play will be 'scissors' to beat my 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves based on the given strategies and the interaction history:

1. **Round 0 to 1**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'scissors' to my 'rock'.
   - Possible strategies: 
     - Play the same move as their opponent's last round move (since I played 'scissors' in round 1).
     - Play the move that would lose to their last round move (since they played 'scissors' again).

2. **Round 1 to 2**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' after a tie with 'scissors'.
   - Possible strategies:
     - Play the move that would beat their last round move (since 'paper' beats 'scissors').

3. **Round 2 to 3**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' after winning with 'paper' against my 'rock'.
   - Possible strategies:
     - Play the same move as they did in the last round (since they played 'paper' again).

4. **Round 3 to 4**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'paper' to my 'scissors'.
   - Possible strategies:
     - Play the move that would beat their last round move (since 'scissors' beats 'paper').

5. **Round 4 to 5**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after winning with 'scissors' against my 'paper'.
   - Possible strategies:
     - Play the same move as they did in the last round (since they played 'scissors' again).

6. **Round 5 to 6**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'scissors' to my 'rock'.
   - Possible strategies:
     - Play the same move as they did in the last round (since they played 'scissors' again).

7. **Round 6 to 7**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'scissors' to my 'rock'.
   - Possible strategies:
     - Play the same move as they did in the last round (since they played 'scissors' again).

8. **Round 7 to 8**:
   - Opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'scissors' to my 'rock'.
   - Possible strategies:
     - Play the move that would beat their last round move (since 'rock' beats 'scissors').

9. **Round 8 to 9**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' after losing with 'rock' to my 'paper'.
   - Possible strategies:
     - Play the move that would beat their last round move (since 'paper' beats 'rock').

10. **Round 9 to 10**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'paper' to my 'scissors'.
    - Possible strategies:
      - Play the move that would beat their last round move (since 'scissors' beats 'paper').

11. **Round 10 to 11**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'scissors' to my 'rock'.
    - Possible strategies:
      - Play the move that would beat their last round move (since 'rock' beats 'scissors').

12. **Round 11 to 12**:
    - Opponent played 'paper' after losing with 'rock' to my 'paper'.
    - Possible strategies:
      - Play the move that would beat their last round move (since 'paper' beats 'rock').

13. **Round 12 to 13**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'paper' to my 'scissors'.
    - Possible strategies:
      - Play the move that would beat their last round move (since 'scissors' beats 'paper').

14. **Round 13 to 14**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after winning with 'scissors' against my 'paper'.
    - Possible strategies:
      - Play the same move as they did in the last round (since they played 'scissors' again).

15. **Round 14 to 15**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'scissors' to my 'rock'.
    - Possible strategies:
      - Play the same move as they did in the last round (since they played 'scissors' again).

Based on the analysis, the opponent seems to be following a pattern where they often repeat their last move, especially after a win or a loss. This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 16, {'round': 15, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 6, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 7, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 9, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 10, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 11, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 12, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 13, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 14, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 15, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}].

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the potential strategies.

1. **Round 0 to 1**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'scissors' (tie). 
   - Possible strategies: Same move as last round, or the move that would lose to their last round's move.

2. **Round 1 to 2**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' after 'scissors' (tie).
   - Possible strategies: Move that would beat their last round's move.

3. **Round 2 to 3**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' after 'paper' (win).
   - Possible strategies: Same move as last round.

4. **Round 3 to 4**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'paper' (loss).
   - Possible strategies: Move that would beat their last round's move.

5. **Round 4 to 5**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'scissors' (tie).
   - Possible strategies: Same move as last round, or the move that would lose to their last round's move.

6. **Round 5 to 6**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'scissors' (tie).
   - Possible strategies: Same move as last round, or the move that would lose to their last round's move.

7. **Round 6 to 7**:
   - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'scissors' (tie).
   - Possible strategies: Same move as last round, or the move that would lose to their last round's move.

8. **Round 7 to 8**:
   - Opponent played 'rock' after 'scissors' (loss).
   - Possible strategies: Move that would beat their last round's move.

9. **Round 8 to 9**:
   - Opponent played 'paper' after 'rock' (loss).
   - Possible strategies: Move that would beat their last round's move.

10. **Round 9 to 10**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'paper' (loss).
    - Possible strategies: Move that would beat their last round's move.

11. **Round 10 to 11**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' after 'scissors' (loss).
    - Possible strategies: Move that would beat their last round's move.

12. **Round 11 to 12**:
    - Opponent played 'paper' after 'rock' (loss).
    - Possible strategies: Move that would beat their last round's move.

13. **Round 12 to 13**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'paper' (loss).
    - Possible strategies: Move that would beat their last round's move.

14. **Round 13 to 14**:
    - Opponent played 'scissors' after 'scissors' (tie).
    - Possible strategies: Same move as last round, or the move that would lose to their last round's move.

15. **Round 14 to 15**:
    - Opponent played 'rock' after 'scissors' (loss).
    - Possible strategies: Move that would beat their last round's move.

The opponent seems to frequently play the move that would beat their last round's move, especially after losses. This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (opponent played rock and lost to my paper), they are likely to play the move that would lose to their last round's move, which is scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'paper' next to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next, I should play 'scissors' to counter their move.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last move after a loss. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous move 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

From the analysis, it seems that the opponent's strategy is most consistent with the following pattern:
- After a win, they play the same move.
- After a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

Based on the analysis, the opponent seems to follow a pattern where they often play the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss, and they tend to repeat the same move after a win. This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7940168522161812, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their moves based on the provided history and the potential strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary without a clear pattern of consistently beating, losing to, or copying my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, but not consistently.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move, but again, not consistently.
   - After a tie, the opponent's response varies, sometimes playing the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior doesn't consistently match any of the simpler strategies like always beating or losing to their last move, or copying my last move.
   - The opponent's behavior after wins, losses, and ties seems to be more complex and potentially influenced by both the previous outcome and their previous transition.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the strategy that best fits their behavior is the most complex one, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for different responses based on the combination of the outcome and the transition made in the previous round.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and the opponent played 'rock', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter-move is to play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.
   - For example, in round 0, the opponent played 'scissors' against my 'rock'. In round 1, they repeated 'scissors' against my 'scissors'. In round 2, they switched to 'paper' against my 'rock'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie in round 1 (both played 'scissors'), the opponent switched to 'paper' in round 2, which would beat my 'rock'.
   - After a loss in round 2 (opponent played 'paper' against my 'rock'), they switched to 'paper' again in round 3, which would lose to my 'scissors'.
   - After a win in round 3 (opponent played 'paper' against my 'scissors'), they switched to 'scissors' in round 4, which would beat my 'paper'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they change their move based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - Specifically, after a win, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, they tend to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, they tend to repeat the same move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- **After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.**
- **After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.**
- **After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.**

This aligns with the strategy described as:
"After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Thus, the selected strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my previous moves. For example, when I played 'rock' and they played 'paper', they won. In the next round, they played 'scissors', which would beat 'paper', indicating a possible pattern of playing the move that would beat their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning (e.g., round 2, they played 'paper' against my 'rock'), they played 'scissors' in the next round, which would beat 'paper'.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 1, both played 'scissors'), they played 'rock', which would beat 'scissors'.
   - After losing (e.g., round 0, they played 'scissors' against my 'rock'), they played 'paper', which would beat 'rock'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to consistently play the move that would beat their last move, regardless of the outcome (win, loss, or tie). This aligns with the strategy: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, their last move was 'paper'. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next to beat 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since they won the last round with 'paper', it is likely they will play 'paper' again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.9223398951, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to win the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.9733625840193, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.3869476661694571, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent has played scissors after I played paper in the last round multiple times (e.g., rounds 4, 6, 13, 33, 48). This suggests they might be playing the move that beats my last move.
   - However, there are also instances where they played rock after I played paper (e.g., rounds 8, 11, 15, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 35, 43, 46), which indicates they might be playing the move that loses to my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After winning, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 1, 38).
   - After losing, they often play the move that would beat their last move (e.g., rounds 2, 16, 39, 40).
   - After a tie, they sometimes play the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., rounds 37, 38).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to change based on the outcome of the previous round. They often play the move that would beat their last move after a loss, and sometimes repeat their move after a win.
   - This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play rock in the next round to beat their last move, which was scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves are: Scissors, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Scissors, Paper, Paper, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Rock, Paper, Scissors, Scissors.
   - The opponent seems to frequently play the move that would beat my last move. For example, when I played Rock, they often played Paper, and when I played Paper, they often played Scissors.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to continue with a move that would beat my last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent also seems to play the move that would beat my last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat my last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior. The opponent frequently plays the move that would beat my previous move, regardless of the outcome (win, lose, or tie).

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and since I last played paper, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions step by step:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves are: scissors, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, scissors.
   - The opponent seems to frequently play the move that would beat my last move. For example, when I played rock, they often played paper, and when I played scissors, they often played rock.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After winning, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After losing, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy seems to predict the opponent's moves most accurately based on the observed patterns. Therefore, the selected strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.7897230494961238, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to beat 'rock'.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter and beat 'rock'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round where they played scissors, they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter this.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter this.

```python

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.3999424498327022, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or choose a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent's behavior after a win, loss, or tie suggests a mixed strategy that involves repeating moves, choosing moves that would beat or lose to their last move, and sometimes mirroring my last move.
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is the one where the opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made.

Given the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the last one described in the list, which involves complex transitions based on the previous outcome and transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play rock in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter-move is paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 26 to 75, the opponent's moves seem to vary without a clear pattern of repeating the same move or consistently countering my last move.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays the move that would beat their last move, such as in round 33 (opponent played scissors after playing paper in round 32).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 27 to 28, opponent played scissors then rock).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 51 to 52, opponent played rock then paper).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 74 to 75, opponent played scissors then paper).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior after wins, losses, and ties aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."
   - This strategy explains the observed moves most accurately, as it accounts for the opponent's tendency to change their move based on the outcome of the previous round.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both of us playing paper, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, I should play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.7059718004180241, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', their likely play in the next round is 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.1941802602926168, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 76: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 28 to 77, we can observe the opponent's responses to my plays. 
   - For example, in round 28, I played 'paper' and the opponent played 'rock', which I won. In round 29, I played 'scissors' and the opponent played 'paper', which I also won. This pattern continues with me winning several rounds in a row.
   - However, the opponent's response doesn't seem to consistently follow a pattern of playing the move that would beat their last move or lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent's next move doesn't consistently follow a pattern of repeating the same move or playing the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent's next move also doesn't consistently follow a pattern of playing the move that would beat their last move or lose to their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's next move doesn't consistently follow a pattern of playing the same move or playing the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior doesn't seem to fit the simpler strategies like playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move, or playing the same move as their last move.
   - The more complex strategies involving conditional responses based on the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition seem more likely.
   - The strategy that involves the opponent's transition depending on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to fit the observed behavior better, as it accounts for the lack of a consistent pattern in their responses.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the complex one where the opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses and aligns with the observed behavior.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played paper, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.43592618220483176, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's plays seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch based on the previous round's outcome.
   - For example, in round 39, the opponent played 'paper' after playing 'scissors' in round 38, which would beat their previous move. This suggests a potential pattern of playing the move that would beat their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After ties, such as in rounds 37 and 38, the opponent played 'rock' and 'scissors' respectively, which are the same moves as the previous round. This suggests they might repeat moves after ties.
   - After losses, such as in round 33, the opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'rock', which would beat their last move. This suggests they might play the move that would beat their last move after a loss.
   - After wins, such as in round 32, the opponent switched from 'paper' to 'scissors', which would beat their last move. This suggests they might play the move that would beat their last move after a win.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy accurately predicts the opponent's observed moves, considering their responses to wins, losses, and ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock, my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best explains their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they play the move that would beat my last move. For example, in round 79, I played 'paper', and they played 'scissors', which beats 'paper'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move. For instance, in round 33, they won with 'scissors' against my 'paper', and in round 34, they played 'scissors' again.
   - After a loss, they sometimes play the move that would beat their last move. For example, in round 30, they lost with 'scissors' against my 'rock', and in round 31, they played 'rock', which beats 'scissors'.
   - After a tie, their behavior seems inconsistent, but there are instances where they play the move that would lose to their last move. For example, in round 37, both played 'rock', and in round 38, they played 'scissors', which loses to 'rock'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that predicts their behavior most accurately is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy aligns with the observed patterns in the opponent's behavior across different outcomes (win, loss, tie).

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since they won the last round with scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.86456587634738, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.35354609558715133, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat their previous move or choose a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they adjust their move based on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically, they might repeat their move after a win, choose a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and choose a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:
- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This aligns with the following strategy description:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.547482266911006, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 86: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For example, after I won with 'paper' against their 'rock' in round 86, they might change their move in the next round.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, they seem to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior varies, but they might choose a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they change their move based on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically, they might repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and choose a move that loses to their last move after a tie.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- **After a win:** The opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- **After a loss:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- **After a tie:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This strategy is consistent with the observed behavior in the interaction history.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent often repeats their move.
   - **Losses:** The opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** The opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to match the observed behavior.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter it and win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.778266310786393, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat their previous 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.9239453445997328, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses:** The opponent often chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** The opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with a strategy that considers the outcome of the previous round and adjusts their move accordingly.
   - The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Based on the analysis, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 94 Analysis:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I lost

2. **Round 93 Analysis:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: Tie

3. **Round 92 Analysis:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I won

4. **Round 91 Analysis:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I won

5. **Round 90 Analysis:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I won

6. **Round 89 Analysis:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I won

7. **Round 88 Analysis:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Outcome: I won

8. **Round 87 Analysis:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Outcome: I won

9. **Round 86 Analysis:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Outcome: I won

10. **Round 85 Analysis:**
    - My play: Scissors
    - Opponent's play: Rock
    - Outcome: I lost

11. **Round 84 Analysis:**
    - My play: Paper
    - Opponent's play: Rock
    - Outcome: I won

12. **Round 83 Analysis:**
    - My play: Rock
    - Opponent's play: Scissors
    - Outcome: I won

13. **Round 82 Analysis:**
    - My play: Scissors
    - Opponent's play: Paper
    - Outcome: I won

14. **Round 81 Analysis:**
    - My play: Paper
    - Opponent's play: Rock
    - Outcome: I won

15. **Round 80 Analysis:**
    - My play: Rock
    - Opponent's play: Scissors
    - Outcome: I won

16. **Round 79 Analysis:**
    - My play: Paper
    - Opponent's play: Scissors
    - Outcome: I lost

17. **Round 78 Analysis:**
    - My play: Rock
    - Opponent's play: Rock
    - Outcome: Tie

18. **Round 77 Analysis:**
    - My play: Paper
    - Opponent's play: Paper
    - Outcome: Tie

19. **Round 76 Analysis:**
    - My play: Scissors
    - Opponent's play: Rock
    - Outcome: I lost

20. **Round 75 Analysis:**
    - My play: Paper
    - Opponent's play: Paper
    - Outcome: Tie

21. **Round 74 Analysis:**
    - My play: Scissors
    - Opponent's play: Scissors
    - Outcome: Tie

From the analysis, it seems that the opponent's behavior changes based on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically, after a loss, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

This pattern aligns with the following strategy:
- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played paper and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 46 to 95, the opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are some patterns. For instance, when I played 'scissors' and won, the opponent played 'paper' (round 95), which would lose to my 'scissors'. This suggests that the opponent might be playing the move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 74 to 75, both ties with 'scissors' and 'paper', respectively).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 94, opponent played 'paper' after losing with 'scissors' in round 93).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 74 to 75).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."
   - This strategy explains the observed moves: after a win, the opponent tries to beat their last move; after a loss, they switch to a move that would lose to their last move; after a tie, they repeat the move.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Analyzing Patterns:**
   - The opponent's moves after ties, wins, and losses seem to vary, indicating a complex strategy.
   - The opponent often repeats the same move after a tie, as seen in rounds 75-76 and 77-78.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would beat their last move, as seen in rounds 48-49 and 85-86.
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move, as seen in rounds 80-81 and 81-82.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the same move, as seen in rounds 75-76 and 77-78.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move, as seen in rounds 48-49 and 85-86.
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move, as seen in rounds 80-81 and 81-82.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior:
     - After a win, the opponent often repeats the same move.
     - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move.
     - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the same move, which is a slight deviation but close enough given the complexity of the strategy.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, we both played paper, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they will play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played paper, they will likely play rock next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a different one. For example, in round 94, they played 'paper' after I played 'rock', which beat my 'rock'. In round 95, they switched to 'paper' again, which lost to my 'scissors'. This indicates a possible pattern of repeating moves after certain outcomes.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 94 where they won with 'paper' against my 'rock'), they repeated 'paper' in round 95, which suggests they might repeat their winning move.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 95 where they lost with 'paper' against my 'scissors'), they switched to 'paper' again in round 96, which resulted in a tie against my 'paper'.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 96 where both played 'paper'), they switched to 'rock' in round 97, which lost to my 'paper'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switch to a move that would lose to their last move after a tie. This is consistent with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but we need to check if there's a consistent pattern in how they respond to my moves.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - Let's examine how the opponent's move changes after different outcomes (win, loss, tie).

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This would mean if they played 'rock' last, they would play 'paper' next. This doesn't consistently match the history.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This would mean if they played 'rock' last, they would play 'scissors' next. This also doesn't consistently match the history.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This would mean if I played 'rock' last, they would play 'paper' next. This doesn't consistently match the history.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This would mean if I played 'rock' last, they would play 'rock' next. This doesn't consistently match the history.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This strategy seems to fit some of the patterns observed, but not consistently.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
     - This strategy seems to fit some of the patterns observed, but not consistently.
   - **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made.
     - This strategy is complex and considers multiple factors, which might explain the variability in the opponent's moves.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, Strategy 7 seems to be the most fitting as it accounts for multiple conditions and transitions. The opponent's moves don't consistently follow a simple pattern, suggesting a more complex decision-making process.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played scissors and won against the opponent's paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (paper vs. scissors), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as in the last round. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and won. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be 'scissors' again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'paper' next to beat 'rock'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9758066376603791, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous move 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round, my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.99170167671751, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'paper' next to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round, my best move to counter this would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to Moves:**
   - The opponent's plays seem to be reactive to my last move. For example, in round 111, I played 'paper', and the opponent played 'scissors', which beats 'paper'.
   - In round 110, I played 'scissors', and the opponent played 'paper', which loses to 'scissors'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent's next move doesn't consistently follow a pattern of repeating the winning move or choosing a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to choose a move that would beat my last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less clear, but there are instances where they choose a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior after a loss seems to align with the strategy: "After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
   - The opponent's behavior after a win and tie is less consistent, but the strategy that best fits the observed behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Given the analysis, the strategy that most accurately predicts the opponent's moves is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat their last move 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to beat 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent played 'scissors' in rounds 111 and 112, both times after I played 'paper'. This suggests they might be playing a move that beats my last move.
   - However, in round 101, they also played 'scissors' after I played 'paper', which resulted in a win for them. In round 102, they switched to 'scissors' again, which doesn't align with playing the move that beats my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning in round 101 with 'scissors', they played 'scissors' again in round 102, which suggests they might repeat their move after a win.
   - After losing in round 102 with 'scissors', they switched to 'rock' in round 103, which beats 'scissors'. This suggests they might switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss.
   - After tying in round 93 with 'scissors', they switched to 'rock' in round 94, which beats 'scissors'. This suggests they might switch to a move that beats their last move after a tie.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and switch to a move that beats their last move after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since they won the last round with scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat their previous 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8549637105641383, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since I won with scissors against their paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they play moves that beat or lose to my previous move. This suggests some level of adaptation or pattern recognition.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's response varies, sometimes repeating the same move or switching to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior after a win, loss, or tie seems to align with a strategy where they adapt based on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically, they tend to:
     - Repeat the same move after a win or switch to a move that would beat their last move.
     - Switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.
     - Vary their response after a tie, sometimes repeating the same move or switching to a move that would lose to their last move.

Given these observations, the opponent's strategy aligns most closely with the following description:

- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This strategy explains the observed behavior in the interaction history. Therefore, the selected strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won, so I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the given history:

1. **Patterns in Responses**:
   - The opponent's moves after each round should be analyzed to see if they follow a specific pattern based on their previous move or the outcome of the round.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - We need to check if the opponent's next move is influenced by whether they won, lost, or tied the previous round.

3. **Strategy Analysis**:
   - Let's look at the last few rounds to see if we can identify a consistent pattern:

   - **Round 116**: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'paper', opponent won.
   - **Round 117**: Opponent played 'scissors', I played 'rock', opponent lost.
   - **Round 118**: I need to predict the opponent's next move.

   - Observing the pattern:
     - After winning in round 116 with 'scissors', the opponent played 'scissors' again in round 117.
     - After losing in round 117 with 'scissors', we need to predict what they will play in round 118.

   - The opponent repeated their move after a win (round 116 to 117). After a loss (round 117), we need to see if they switch to a move that would beat their last move or if they follow another pattern.

4. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win. After a loss, they might switch to a move that beats their last move.
   - This matches the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, their next play is likely to be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to ensure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Top hypotheses: {117: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the provided strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, and there isn't a consistent pattern of them playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move or my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie (e.g., rounds 75, 93, 96, 118), the opponent's next move doesn't consistently follow a pattern of playing the move that would lose to their last move or playing the same move.
   - After a win (e.g., rounds 70, 81, 84, 89, 92, 97, 103, 106, 109, 114), the opponent's next move doesn't consistently follow a pattern of playing the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss (e.g., rounds 76, 79, 85, 94, 99, 101, 111, 112, 116), the opponent's next move doesn't consistently follow a pattern of playing the move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" doesn't fit well as the opponent doesn't consistently follow these patterns.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" also doesn't fit well as the opponent doesn't consistently follow these patterns.
   - The strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." is complex and considers multiple factors, which might explain the variability in the opponent's moves.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's moves, the last strategy seems to best explain their behavior as it accounts for different transitions based on both the outcome and previous transitions.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, we both played paper, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, and there is no consistent pattern of them playing a move that directly counters my last move. For example, in round 119, both played 'rock', which resulted in a tie, and there is no clear indication that they are playing to beat my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 80 to 81, they played 'scissors' after winning with 'scissors').
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 76 to 77, they lost with 'scissors' and played 'paper' next).
   - After a tie, they sometimes switch to a move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 74 to 75, they tied with 'scissors' and played 'paper' next).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior after a win, loss, or tie seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains their behavior most accurately, as it accounts for their tendency to repeat moves after a win, switch to a counter-move after a loss, and switch to a losing move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played rock, resulting in a tie. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play scissors next, as it would lose to their last move, rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter-move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves after each round need to be analyzed to see if they follow a consistent pattern.
   - We should check if the opponent's move is based on their previous move, my previous move, or the outcome of the previous round.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, does the opponent repeat their move, change it, or choose a move that would beat or lose to their previous move?
   - After a loss, does the opponent change their move to beat my last move, or do they follow a different pattern?
   - After a tie, does the opponent repeat their move, or do they choose a move that would beat or lose to their last move?

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - We need to match the observed behavior with the given strategies to find the best fit.

Let's analyze the recent rounds:

- **Round 119**: Opponent played 'rock', resulting in a tie.
- **Round 120**: Opponent played 'scissors', which loses to their previous move 'rock'.

This suggests that after a tie, the opponent plays a move that would lose to their last move. This matches the strategy where after a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

- **Round 118**: Opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie.
- **Round 119**: Opponent played 'rock', which loses to their previous move 'paper'.

Again, after a tie, the opponent plays a move that would lose to their last move.

- **Round 117**: Opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a loss.
- **Round 118**: Opponent played 'paper', which beats their previous move 'scissors'.

This suggests that after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

The observed behavior aligns with the strategy:
- After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This matches the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Let's output this strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors against my rock), they are likely to play the move that would lose to their last move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.882351, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors against my rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9861587127989999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {117: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.395252438490057, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Analyzing Patterns:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to frequently counter my previous move, especially after I win.
   - After I lose, the opponent often plays the move that would beat my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After I win, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat my last move.
   - After I lose, the opponent seems to play the move that would beat my last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's response is less clear but seems to sometimes repeat their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" does not fit well because the opponent doesn't consistently play the losing move after a loss.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" also doesn't fit well because the opponent doesn't consistently repeat moves after a win.
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move" seems to fit well, as the opponent frequently plays the move that would counter my last move.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and since I last played paper, I predict that their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {133: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change in response to the outcome of the previous round. For example, after losing, they often switch to a move that would beat their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last move. For instance, in round 85, they played 'rock' after losing with 'rock' in round 84.
   - After a win, they sometimes repeat their last move, as seen in rounds 88 and 89.
   - After a tie, their behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with a strategy where they change their move based on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically:
     - After a win, they might repeat their move or switch to a move that would beat their last move.
     - After a loss, they switch to a move that would beat their last move.
     - After a tie, they might switch to a move that would lose to their last move or repeat their move.

The strategy that best fits this pattern is:
- "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the observed behavior most accurately, considering the opponent's tendency to adapt based on the previous round's outcome.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round, as rock would lose to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent consistently plays 'rock' when I play 'paper', resulting in my wins. This suggests they might not be adapting based on my moves.
   - When I play 'scissors', they often play 'paper', which I win against.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 86 to 87, 89 to 90).
   - After a loss, they do not consistently switch to a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After a tie, their behavior is inconsistent, sometimes repeating the move or switching.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent does not seem to follow a simple pattern of playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move.
   - They do not consistently play the move that would beat my last move.
   - The strategy where the opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems overly complex for the observed behavior.

Given the analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains the observed repetition after wins and the occasional switch after losses or ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be influenced by my previous moves. For example, when I played 'scissors' and won, the opponent played 'paper' (round 135), which I beat with 'scissors'. This suggests a pattern where the opponent might be playing the move that would lose to my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not seem to change drastically based on the outcome (win, lose, or tie). For example, after losing in round 134 (opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper'), they played 'paper' in round 135, which lost to my 'scissors'. This suggests a consistent pattern rather than a change based on the outcome.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well. For instance, in round 135, the opponent played 'paper', which would lose to their previous move 'rock' from round 134. This pattern is consistent in several rounds, indicating that the opponent might be following this strategy.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would lose to their last round's move, and since they played 'paper' last round, I predict their next play will be 'rock' (as rock loses to paper).

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's moves after my plays of 'scissors', 'rock', and 'paper' need to be analyzed to see if there's a consistent pattern.
   - The opponent seems to frequently play the move that beats my last move, especially when I lose.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After I win, the opponent often changes their move to beat my last move.
   - After I lose, the opponent continues to play the move that beats my last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior seems less predictable, but they often switch to a move that would beat my last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior suggests they are likely playing the move that would beat my last move. This is evident from the frequent losses I incur when I play the same move consecutively.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be reactive to my last move rather than sticking to a fixed pattern regardless of the outcome.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move, and I played 'paper' last, I believe their next play will be 'scissors' to beat my 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7497431067384681, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }
            ```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves after each round are crucial to understanding their strategy.
   - We need to check if the opponent's move is consistent with any of the given strategies.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - We should look at how the opponent's move changes after a win, loss, or tie.
   - Specifically, we need to see if they repeat moves, switch to a move that beats or loses to their previous move, or mimic my last move.

3. **Strategy Comparison**:
   - **Strategy 1**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - **Strategy 2**: The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - **Strategy 3**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
   - **Strategy 4**: The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
   - **Strategy 5**: After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - **Strategy 6**: After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
   - **Strategy 7**: Complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

**Analysis**:
- From rounds 89 to 138, the opponent's moves and outcomes need to be checked against each strategy.
- For example, after a win, if they consistently play the same move or a move that beats their last move, it could indicate a specific strategy.
- After a tie, if they play a move that loses to their last move, it could indicate another strategy.

**Conclusion**:
- Based on the history, the opponent's behavior seems to align with **Strategy 5**: After a win, they repeat the move. After a loss, they play the move that beats their last move. After a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves after ties, wins, and losses need to be examined to identify any consistent behavior.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - **Wins**: After a win, the opponent often repeats the same move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses**: After a loss, the opponent often chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties**: After a tie, the opponent often chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to align with the observed behavior:
     - After wins, the opponent sometimes repeats their move.
     - After losses, they often play a move that would beat their previous move.
     - After ties, they often play a move that would lose to their previous move.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played 'rock', resulting in a tie. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best move to counter this would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves after each round need to be examined to see if there's a consistent pattern in response to my moves or their own previous moves.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - We need to check if the opponent's behavior changes after a win, loss, or tie. This can help identify if they are using a strategy that depends on the outcome of the previous round.

3. **Strategy Comparison**:
   - Compare the opponent's moves with the possible strategies to see which one aligns most closely with their observed behavior.

**Step-by-step Analysis**:

- **Rounds 91-140**: 
  - The opponent's moves and outcomes need to be checked to see if they follow a consistent pattern.
  - For example, if the opponent consistently plays a move that would beat their last move, or if they play a move that would beat my last move.

- **Outcome-Based Behavior**:
  - After a win, does the opponent repeat their move, or do they change it?
  - After a loss, do they switch to a move that would beat their previous move?
  - After a tie, do they repeat their move or switch to a different one?

- **Strategy Matching**:
  - Compare the opponent's moves with each strategy description to see which one fits best.

**Conclusion**:

Based on the interaction history, the opponent seems to follow a pattern where they often play the move that would beat their last move after a win, and after a loss, they might switch to a move that would beat their previous move. This suggests a strategy that considers the outcome of the previous round and adjusts accordingly.

The strategy that best fits this behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9361606081146903, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior.

   - The opponent's moves after ties, wins, and losses need to be examined to identify any consistent patterns.
   - After a tie, the opponent played 'rock' again (round 146 to 147), which suggests they might be repeating their move or following a specific pattern after ties.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent's behavior after winning rounds (e.g., rounds 97, 98, 100, etc.) shows they often switch to a move that beats their last move. For instance, after winning with 'rock' in round 100, they played 'paper' in round 101.
   - **Losses:** After losing, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move. For example, after losing with 'paper' in round 99, they played 'rock' in round 100.
   - **Ties:** After ties, the opponent seems to play the same move again, as seen from round 146 to 147.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy aligns with the observed behavior, where the opponent changes their move based on the outcome of the previous round, specifically repeating the move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round ended in a tie with both playing rock, I predict that the opponent will play rock again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent often plays "scissors" when I play "paper," suggesting they might be trying to beat my last move.
   - However, there are instances where they play "rock" when I play "rock," indicating they might sometimes repeat my move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning (e.g., round 99, 101, 111, 116, 132, 136, 147), the opponent tends to play the move that would beat my last move (e.g., they played "scissors" after I played "paper").
   - After losing (e.g., round 98, 100, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 113, 114, 115, 117, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 133, 134, 135, 137, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145), they often play the move that would beat my last move.
   - After ties (e.g., round 118, 119, 138, 139, 146), the opponent's response is less predictable, but they sometimes play the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Given the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent frequently plays "scissors" when I play "paper," resulting in my loss. This suggests they might be predicting my moves or following a pattern that counters my frequent plays.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 101, 111, 116, 132, 136, 147, 148), the opponent tends to play "scissors" again, which indicates they might be sticking to a winning move.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 100, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 113, 114, 115, 117, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 133, 134, 135, 137, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145), the opponent seems to switch strategies, often playing a move that beats my previous move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 118, 119, 138, 139, 146), the opponent's response is less predictable, but they often play a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with a strategy where they repeat a winning move, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and play a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:
- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This matches the strategy described as:
```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7788721620083372, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to beat their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays of paper, rock, and scissors seem to vary. There is no consistent pattern of them choosing a move that would beat or lose to my last move.
   - The opponent has played scissors after I played paper multiple times, indicating they might be trying to beat my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their last move (e.g., rounds 104-105, 113-114, 123-124).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., rounds 101-102, 111-112).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., rounds 118-119, 138-139).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after winning, switch to a winning move after losing, and play a losing move after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is most likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both played paper, resulting in a tie. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock next, as it loses to paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent seems to frequently play 'rock' when I play 'scissors', 'scissors' when I play 'paper', and 'paper' when I play 'rock'. This indicates a tendency to play the move that beats my last move.
   - However, there are instances where the opponent's move doesn't directly counter my last move, suggesting a more complex strategy.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, but not consistently.
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move, suggesting an adjustment strategy.
   - After a tie, the opponent's response varies, sometimes repeating their move or switching to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to partially fit, but not entirely.
   - The strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." seems to fit better. This strategy accounts for the opponent's varied responses based on both the outcome and their previous transition, which aligns with the observed behavior.

Given the analysis, the most fitting strategy is the complex one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy explains the varied responses observed in the interaction history.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and won against the opponent's rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played rock last, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, I should play scissors to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it against the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves after each round need to be analyzed to see if they follow a consistent pattern based on their previous move or the outcome of the round.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** Check if the opponent repeats their move, changes to a move that beats their last move, or changes to a move that would lose to their last move.
   - **Losses:** Check if the opponent changes to a move that beats their last move, loses to their last move, or repeats their last move.
   - **Ties:** Check if the opponent repeats their move, changes to a move that beats their last move, or changes to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching:**
   - We need to match the observed behavior with the strategies provided.

Let's analyze the recent rounds:

- **Round 151:** Opponent played 'rock', I played 'paper', I won.
- **Round 152:** Opponent played 'paper', I played 'scissors', I won.

From this, we can see:
- After losing in round 151, the opponent played 'paper' in round 152, which would beat their previous move 'rock'. This matches the behavior of playing the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss.

Now, let's consider the strategies:

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - This matches the observed behavior in round 152.

- **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This does not match the observed behavior.

- **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - This does not match the observed behavior.

- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - This does not match the observed behavior.

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This matches the observed behavior in round 152.

- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - This does not match the observed behavior.

- **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
  - This does not match the observed behavior.

Based on the analysis, Strategy 5 is the best fit for the opponent's behavior so far.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played paper and I played scissors), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper to beat their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they tend to play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost, so they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter and beat 'scissors'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' next to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9995784154540093, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {80: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3997934235724645, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to follow a pattern where they often play the move that would beat their last move or the move that would beat my last move. However, there are instances where they repeat their previous move, indicating a more complex strategy.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits these observations is the one where the opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This strategy accounts for the variability in their responses after wins, losses, and ties, and it explains the observed behavior most accurately.

Given this analysis, the strategy that aligns with the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by my opponent, I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {80: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.5798553965007252, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move. This suggests some conditional behavior based on the outcome of the previous round.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent occasionally switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy that considers both the outcome of the previous round and their last move. Specifically, the strategy where:
     - After a win, the opponent sometimes plays the same move or the move that would beat their last move.
     - After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last move.
     - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the same move or the move that would lose to their last move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {80: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.19412914428535533, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history and the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - In round 176, the opponent played 'paper' against my 'rock', which resulted in a win for them.
   - In round 175, the opponent played 'scissors' against my 'paper', which resulted in a win for them.
   - In round 174, the opponent played 'rock' against my 'rock', resulting in a tie.
   - In round 173, the opponent played 'paper' against my 'paper', resulting in a tie.
   - In round 172, the opponent played 'scissors' against my 'rock', resulting in a loss for them.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win in round 175, the opponent played 'paper' in round 176, which beats their previous move 'scissors'.
   - After a tie in round 174, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 175, which beats 'rock', their move from round 174.
   - After a tie in round 173, the opponent played 'rock' in round 174, which loses to 'paper', their move from round 173.
   - After a loss in round 172, the opponent played 'paper' in round 173, which beats 'scissors', their move from round 172.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last move after a win.
   - After a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last move.
   - After a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.

This behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

However, upon closer inspection, the opponent's behavior does not perfectly match any single strategy. The closest match is the strategy where the opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This strategy accounts for the complexity observed in their behavior.

Therefore, the best explanation for the opponent's behavior is the complex strategy described in the last option.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'paper' last, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {80: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.43589040099974874, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my previous moves. For instance, when I played 'rock' in round 177 and lost, the opponent played 'paper', which beats 'rock'. This suggests a possible pattern of countering my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning (e.g., round 176), the opponent repeated the winning move 'paper' in round 177.
   - After losing (e.g., round 175), the opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'paper', which would beat their previous move.
   - After ties (e.g., round 173), the opponent repeated the move 'paper' in round 174.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win or a tie and switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss. This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Given the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and match it against the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays seem to vary. For example, after I played 'scissors' and won against their 'paper' in round 178, they might choose a move that beats 'scissors' next, which would be 'rock'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, they sometimes choose a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, their response seems inconsistent, sometimes repeating the move or choosing a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit some of the patterns observed.
   - However, the strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." seems to account for more complex patterns, including the observed behavior after wins, losses, and ties, and how they transition based on their previous move.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the latter strategy seems to best explain their behavior so far.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my best counter-move is 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', I should play 'paper' to counter their 'rock' and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8645572852800396, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be to play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since I played scissors and they played paper), they are likely to play the move that beats their last move. Since their last move was paper, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter-move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9840653000559113, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {80: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3888457100391379, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - In round 188, the opponent played 'paper' against my 'rock', which resulted in their win. In round 189, they played 'paper' again, which suggests they might repeat their move after a win.
   - In round 177, the opponent played 'paper' against my 'rock', resulting in their win. In round 178, they played 'paper' again, which supports the idea that they repeat their move after a win.
   - In round 176, the opponent played 'paper' against my 'rock', resulting in their win. In round 177, they played 'paper' again, which is consistent with the pattern of repeating the move after a win.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After wins, the opponent seems to repeat their move.
   - After losses, the opponent's behavior is less clear from the given data, but there are instances where they switch moves.
   - After ties, there are instances where they switch moves.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior. The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win, which is consistent with the observed pattern.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {80: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.5721919970273965, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 189: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and match it against the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be influenced by their previous move and the outcome of the round.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win (e.g., round 146 to 147, 173 to 174), but this is not consistent.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 175 to 176, 176 to 177).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 146 to 147) or switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 178 to 179).
   - **Losses:** The opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 175 to 176, 176 to 177).
   - **Ties:** The opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 150 to 151) or switches to a move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 173 to 174).

3. **Strategy Matching:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to match some of the observed behavior, but not consistently.
   - The strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." seems to capture the complexity of the opponent's behavior, as it accounts for different transitions based on the outcome and the previous transition.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the last strategy seems to best explain the observed patterns. It accounts for the opponent's behavior changing based on both the outcome and their previous transition, which aligns with the observed history.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played 'paper' which loses to my 'scissors' from two rounds ago), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat their previous 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, their next play is likely to be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9879154827836122, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after they lose, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {80: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3998327347265227, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For example, after a win, they often play the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, they seem to play the move that would lose to their last round's move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win: The opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss: The opponent often plays the move that would lose to their last move.
   - After a tie: The opponent's behavior is less clear, but they sometimes repeat their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to fit the observed behavior.

Let's verify this with a few examples from the history:
- Round 210: Opponent played 'paper' (won), next round played 'scissors' (beat 'paper').
- Round 211: Opponent played 'scissors' (won), next round played 'scissors' (same move).
- Round 209: Opponent played 'rock' (lost), next round played 'scissors' (loses to 'rock').

This pattern aligns with the strategy mentioned above.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat their previous move 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - From rounds 163 to 172, the opponent consistently lost to my moves, indicating no clear pattern of adapting to my plays.
   - Starting from round 173, the opponent's moves seem to be more reactive, especially after losses.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** In rounds 175, 176, and 177, the opponent won, and their subsequent moves were paper, paper, and paper, respectively. This suggests they might be repeating their winning move.
   - **Losses:** In rounds 178 to 184, the opponent lost, and their subsequent moves were rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock,

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent seems to have switched to playing scissors in the last two rounds, possibly in response to my frequent use of paper. Given this pattern, I predict that they might continue with scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the potential strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win, but also instances where they change their move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 213: opponent played 'scissors' after winning with 'scissors' in round 212).
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to change their move to one that would beat their previous move (e.g., round 211: opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'scissors' in round 210).
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but there are instances where they change their move.

3. **Strategy Comparison**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior:
     - After wins, the opponent sometimes repeats their move.
     - After losses, the opponent changes to a move that would beat their previous move.
     - After ties, the opponent's behavior is less consistent, but there are instances where they change to a move that would lose to their previous move.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the potential strategies provided:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays after each round need to be examined to see if they follow a consistent pattern.
   - We need to see if the opponent's move is influenced by their own last move, my last move, or the outcome of the previous round.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties**:
   - After a win, the opponent played 'rock' in round 213 after losing with 'scissors' in round 212. This suggests they might be trying to beat their last move.
   - After a win in round 214, the opponent played 'rock' again, which is the same move as their last round, suggesting they might repeat their move after a win.
   - After a loss in round 211, the opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'rock' in round 213, which beats their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win (round 214 and 213 both 'rock').
   - After a loss, they seem to switch to a move that beats their last move (round 211 'scissors' to round 213 'rock').
   - After a tie, there is no clear pattern in the recent rounds, but earlier ties (round 173 and 174) show the opponent repeating their move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:
- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Therefore, the selected strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and won against the opponent's rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper to beat their previous rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history and the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's move in round 215 was 'rock', which beat my 'scissors'. In round 214, they played 'rock' against my 'paper', which they lost. In round 213, they played 'scissors' against my 'rock', which they lost.
   - Looking at the sequence from rounds 211 to 215, the opponent's moves were 'scissors', 'scissors', 'scissors', 'rock', 'rock'. This suggests a pattern where they repeat moves after a win or loss.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win in round 213, the opponent repeated 'scissors' in round 214.
   - After a loss in round 214, the opponent switched to 'rock' in round 215.
   - After a loss in round 215, they might switch again.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior:
     - After winning in round 213, they repeated 'scissors' in round 214.
     - After losing in round 214, they switched to 'rock' in round 215, which beats 'scissors'.

Given this analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and switch to a losing move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper' to ensure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the recent rounds and see if any patterns emerge that align with the given strategies.

1. **Recent Interaction Analysis:**
   - Round 215: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock' (I lost).
   - Round 216: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper' (tie).
   - Round 217: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper' (tie).

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - From round 215 to 216, after winning with 'rock', the opponent switched to 'paper', which would beat their previous move 'rock'.
   - From round 216 to 217, after a tie with 'paper', the opponent repeated 'paper'.

3. **Strategy Consideration:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit because after playing 'paper' in round 216, they didn't switch to 'scissors' in round 217.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit because after playing 'paper' in round 216, they didn't switch to 'rock' in round 217.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit because after I played 'paper' in round 216, they didn't switch to 'scissors' in round 217.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This fits for round 217, as they repeated 'paper' after I played 'paper' in round 216.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit because after a tie in round 216, they repeated 'paper' instead of switching to 'rock'.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
     - This fits because after a tie in round 216, they repeated 'paper' in round 217.
   - **Strategy 7:** The complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
     - This is too complex for the observed pattern, as the simpler Strategy 6 already fits.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Strategy 6 best explains the opponent's behavior: after a tie, they repeated the same move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted paper play by the opponent, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves after my plays:
     - Round 215: I played scissors, opponent played rock (opponent wins).
     - Round 216: I played paper, opponent played paper (tie).
     - Round 217: I played scissors, opponent played rock (opponent wins).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome**:
   - After a win (round 215), the opponent played the same move (rock) in the next round (round 217).
   - After a tie (round 216), the opponent played rock, which beats their previous move (paper).

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The opponent seems to play the same move after a win, which aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."
   - After a tie, the opponent played a move that would beat their last move, which aligns with the strategy: "After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:
- "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Let's output this strategy in the required format:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict that their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For instance, after I won with paper against rock, the opponent sometimes repeats rock or switches to a move that would beat their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., rounds 170, 180, 190, 200), the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After a loss (e.g., rounds 175, 188, 215), the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After a tie (e.g., rounds 173, 216), the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their previous move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior suggests a strategy that involves changing moves based on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically, they often play the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss, and sometimes repeat their move after a win or tie.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:
- After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

This strategy aligns with the observed patterns in the interaction history.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played rock and I played paper), they will play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 215: opponent played rock after losing with scissors).
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., round 214: opponent won with rock and played rock again in round 215).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 216: opponent tied with paper and played rock in round 217).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to either repeat the same move or play the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategy:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to match the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and switch to a losing move after a tie.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after winning the last round with paper against my rock, they are likely to play the same move, which is paper, in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {189: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3009610980626998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 214: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.28443381300000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior in the recent rounds:

1. **Round 222 to 223:**
   - Round 222: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock' (I won).
   - Round 223: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors' (tie).

   After losing in round 222, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 223. This move would beat their previous move 'rock', which aligns with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

2. **Round 221 to 222:**
   - Round 221: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors' (I won).
   - Round 222: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock' (I won).

   After losing in round 221, the opponent played 'rock' in round 222. This move would beat their previous move 'scissors', which again aligns with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

3. **Round 220 to 221:**
   - Round 220: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper' (I won).
   - Round 221: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors' (I won).

   After losing in round 220, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 221. This move would beat their previous move 'paper', consistent with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

4. **Round 219 to 220:**
   - Round 219: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper' (I lost).
   - Round 220: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper' (I won).

   After winning in round 219, the opponent played 'paper' again in round 220. This move is the same as their last round's move, which aligns with the strategy where after a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

Based on this analysis, the opponent seems to follow the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

Let's select this strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history and the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's move sequence is not directly provided, but we can infer it from the results.
   - For instance, in round 224, I played 'scissors' and the opponent played 'paper', resulting in my win. In round 223, I played 'scissors' and the opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a tie. In round 222, I played 'paper' and the opponent played 'rock', resulting in my win.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (round 222), the opponent played 'scissors' in round 223, which is the move that would beat their last move ('rock').
   - After a tie (round 223), the opponent played 'paper' in round 224, which is the move that would lose to their last move ('scissors').

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to change their move based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, they play the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last move.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round, as 'rock' would lose to 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the recent rounds and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Round 224**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - My reward: 3 (I won)
   - Opponent's next move (Round 225): Scissors

2. **Round 225**:
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - My reward: -1 (I lost)
   - Opponent's next move (Round 226): Unknown

Let's analyze the strategies:

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move**: 
  - Round 224: Opponent played Paper, next move should be Scissors. This matches.
  - Round 225: Opponent played Scissors, next move should be Rock. We don't know Round 226 yet.

- **The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move**: 
  - Round 224: Opponent played Paper, next move should be Rock. This doesn't match.
  - Round 225: Opponent played Scissors, next move should be Paper. We don't know Round 226 yet.

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move**: 
  - Round 224: My play was Scissors, opponent should play Rock. This doesn't match.
  - Round 225: My play was Paper, opponent should play Scissors. This matches.

- **The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move**: 
  - Round 224: My play was Scissors, opponent should play Scissors. This doesn't match.
  - Round 225: My play was Paper, opponent should play Paper. This doesn't match.

- **After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move**: 
  - Round 224: Opponent lost, should play Scissors. This matches.
  - Round 225: Opponent won, should play Scissors again. We don't know Round 226 yet.

- **After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round**: 
  - Round 224: Opponent lost, should play Rock. This doesn't match.
  - Round 225: Opponent won, should play Rock. We don't know Round 226 yet.

- **Complex strategy based on both previous outcome and transition**:
  - This strategy is complex and requires more data to verify. However, based on the limited rounds analyzed, it doesn't seem to fit as well as the simpler strategies.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that fits the best is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they won with scissors. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy that considers both the outcome of the previous round and the move they made. Specifically, the strategy where after a win, they might repeat the move or switch to a move that would beat their last move; after a loss, they switch to a move that would beat their last move; and after a tie, they might repeat the move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- **After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.**
- **After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.**
- **After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.**

This strategy seems to predict their moves most accurately based on the provided history.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the recent rounds and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior:

1. **Round 226**: 
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Result: Tie

2. **Round 227**: 
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Result: Opponent wins

3. **Round 228**: 
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Result: Opponent wins

Let's evaluate the possible strategies:

- **Strategy 1**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - Round 226: Opponent played Rock, so they should play Paper in Round 227. They played Scissors, which doesn't match.
  
- **Strategy 2**: The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - Round 226: Opponent played Rock, so they should play Scissors in Round 227. They played Scissors, which matches.
  
- **Strategy 3**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - Round 226: I played Rock, so they should play Paper in Round 227. They played Scissors, which doesn't match.
  
- **Strategy 4**: The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - Round 226: I played Rock, so they should play Rock in Round 227. They played Scissors, which doesn't match.
  
- **Strategy 5**: After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - Round 226: Tie, opponent should play Scissors in Round 227. They played Scissors, which matches.
  - Round 227: Win, opponent should play Scissors in Round 228. They played Scissors, which matches.
  
- **Strategy 6**: After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - Round 226: Tie, opponent should play Rock in Round 227. They played Scissors, which doesn't match.
  
- **Strategy 7**: Complex strategy based on previous outcomes and transitions.
  - This strategy is complex and requires detailed analysis of multiple rounds, but based on the recent rounds, it doesn't seem to fit as well as Strategy 5.

Based on the analysis, Strategy 5 seems to best explain the opponent's behavior in the recent rounds. They played Scissors after a tie and continued with Scissors after a win, which aligns with Strategy 5.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, I should play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:

The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - From rounds 179 to 210, the opponent consistently lost to my moves, suggesting they might be using a predictable pattern.
   - In round 211, the opponent played scissors after I played paper, resulting in their win. This suggests a possible change in strategy or adaptation.
   - From rounds 212 to 215, the opponent's moves resulted in losses or ties, indicating inconsistency or a change in strategy.
   - In round 216, both players played paper, resulting in a tie.
   - From rounds 217 to 219, the opponent's moves resulted in losses, indicating a lack of adaptation.
   - In round 220, the opponent played paper, resulting in my win with scissors.
   - From rounds 221 to 228, the opponent's moves resulted in a mix of wins, losses, and ties, showing inconsistency.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After wins, the opponent sometimes repeats the winning move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After losses, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move or repeats the losing move.
   - After ties, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently follow a single pattern. However, there are instances where they seem to play the move that would beat their last move or repeat the same move after a win.
   - The opponent's behavior after losses and ties is inconsistent, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific strategy.

Given the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to align most closely with the strategy where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This strategy accounts for the observed inconsistencies and occasional adaptations in their play.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'rock' and won against the opponent's 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', I should play 'paper' to counter it and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.798371140558185, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

Top hypotheses: {189: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.2588597983907296, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 218: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a counter-move. For example, after round 230, the opponent played 'paper' against my 'scissors', and in round 231, they played 'paper' again against my 'paper', resulting in a tie.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 225 where they won with 'scissors' against my 'paper'), they played 'rock' in the next round (round 226), which is the move that would beat their previous move 'scissors'.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 231 where both played 'paper'), they played 'paper' again in the next round, which is the same move as the previous round.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play the same move after a tie, as seen in rounds 231 and 232.
   - After a win, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move, as seen in rounds 225 to 226.
   - The behavior after losses is less clear from the provided data, but there are instances where they switch to a move that would beat their last round's move.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:
- After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

This aligns with the observed behavior and the provided strategies.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they play the move that would beat their last move. For example, in round 232, they played 'rock' after playing 'rock' in round 231, which would beat their own 'rock' if they were following the strategy of playing the move that beats their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., round 188 to 189, where they played 'paper' after winning with 'rock').
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 215 to 216, where they played 'paper' after losing with 'scissors').
   - After a tie, they sometimes repeat the same move (e.g., round 223 to 224, where they played 'scissors' after tying with 'scissors').

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to align with the observed behavior:
     - After wins, the opponent often repeats the same move.
     - After losses, they switch to a move that would beat their last move.
     - After ties, they sometimes play a move that would lose to their last move.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.
   - For example, in round 232, the opponent played 'rock' after playing 'paper' in round 231, which would beat their previous move 'paper'. This suggests a possible pattern of playing a move that beats their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 233), the opponent played 'rock' after winning with 'rock' in round 232, suggesting they might repeat the winning move.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 227), the opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'rock', which would beat their previous move 'scissors'.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 231), the opponent played 'rock' after tying with 'paper', which would beat their previous move 'paper'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."
   - This strategy explains the observed moves, especially the tendency to repeat winning moves and switch to a move that beats their previous move after a loss.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7457889108480202, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost. According to their strategy, they will play the move that beats paper, which is scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:

The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {189: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3128055964208709, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 218: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.16746769013150997, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties**:
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they adjust their moves based on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically, they tend to:
     - Repeat their move or switch to a move that would beat their last move after a win.
     - Switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.
     - Repeat their move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- **After a win**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- **After a loss**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- **After a tie**: The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This aligns with the strategy described as:
"After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Therefore, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict the opponent will play scissors again.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the history provided:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to have a pattern where they often play a move that beats or loses to their previous move or my previous move.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move, especially after a win.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 213-214).
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays a move that would beat their last move (e.g., rounds 238-239).
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes play a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with a strategy where they adjust their move based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - Specifically, after a win, they might repeat their move or play a move that beats their last move. After a loss, they play a move that beats their last move. After a tie, they might play a move that would lose to their last move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This strategy is consistent with the observed patterns in the history.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {189: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.06327474224622681, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch based on the outcome.
   - For example, after a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and switch to a losing move after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both my opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played scissors last, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, I should play scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 191 to 210, the opponent consistently played moves that resulted in my wins. This suggests a lack of adaptation or a fixed pattern.
   - From rounds 211 to 240, the opponent's moves resulted in a mix of wins, losses, and ties for me. This indicates some variability in their strategy.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win for me (e.g., round 240), the opponent played 'paper' which lost to my 'scissors'. This could suggest a pattern of repeating the same move or a specific reaction to losing.
   - After a loss for me (e.g., round 215), the opponent played 'rock' which beat my 'scissors'. This suggests they might be playing the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 223), the opponent played 'scissors' again, resulting in a tie. This suggests they might repeat their move after a tie.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to fit the observed behavior:
     - After a win for me (opponent's loss), they sometimes play a move that would lose to their last move.
     - After a tie, they sometimes repeat the same move.
     - After a loss for me (opponent's win), they sometimes play a move that would beat their last move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played paper and I played scissors), they will play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played paper, they will likely play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has played scissors against my paper multiple times, resulting in my loss (e.g., rounds 211, 212, 225, 227, 241).
   - The opponent has played rock against my scissors, resulting in my loss (e.g., rounds 215, 217, 232).
   - The opponent has played paper against my rock, resulting in my loss (e.g., rounds 219, 238).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning, the opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last move (e.g., after winning with scissors against my paper, they play rock, which beats scissors).
   - After losing, the opponent seems to play the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., after losing with rock against my paper, they play scissors, which loses to rock).
   - After ties, the opponent seems to play the same move (e.g., after tying with scissors against my scissors, they play scissors again).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to align well with the observed behavior.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior is best explained by the strategy where they change their move based on the outcome of the previous round. Therefore, the strategy that fits their behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round to beat their last move, which was scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move is paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played 'scissors' against my 'paper' in the last two rounds, resulting in losses for me.
   - Before that, the opponent's moves have varied, with some rounds resulting in ties and others in losses for me.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win (e.g., round 211, 212, 225, 227, 241, 242), the opponent tends to play the same move that won them the previous round. This is evident as they repeated 'scissors' after winning against my 'paper'.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 213, 215, 217, 219, 232), the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move. For instance, after losing with 'rock' against my 'paper', they switched to 'scissors'.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 216, 223, 226, 231, 237, 239), the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes repeat the same move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat winning moves, switch to a winning move after a loss, and sometimes play a losing move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, the opponent played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves after ties, wins, and losses need to be examined to identify any consistent patterns.
   - For instance, after a tie in round 243, the opponent played 'rock' again, which suggests they might be repeating their move after a tie.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** 
     - Round 194: Opponent played 'rock' and lost to 'paper'. Next round, they played 'paper', which beats 'rock'.
     - Round 195: Opponent played 'paper' and lost to 'scissors'. Next round, they played 'scissors', which beats 'paper'.
     - This suggests that after a loss, they might be playing the move that beats their last move.
   - **Losses:**
     - Round 215: Opponent played 'rock' and won against 'scissors'. Next round, they played 'rock' again.
     - Round 218: Opponent played 'rock' and lost to 'paper'. Next round, they played 'paper', which beats 'rock'.
     - This suggests that after a win, they might be repeating their move.
   - **Ties:**
     - Round 223: Opponent played 'scissors' and tied. Next round, they played 'paper', which loses to 'scissors'.
     - Round 226: Opponent played 'rock' and tied. Next round, they played 'scissors', which loses to 'rock'.
     - This suggests that after a tie, they might be playing the move that loses to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy that best matches these observations is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

Given this analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns with the following strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played 'rock', resulting in a tie. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's plays after each round seem to be influenced by the outcome of the previous round (win, loss, tie).
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win, changes their move after a loss, or maintains the same move after a tie.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** After winning, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses:** After losing, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where their next move is influenced by both the outcome of the previous round and their previous move.
   - The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

Given this analysis, the strategy that most accurately predicts the opponent's observed moves is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the given history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 196 to 210, the opponent consistently played moves that I could beat, suggesting a possible pattern.
   - In rounds 211 and 212, the opponent played scissors against my paper, resulting in my loss.
   - In rounds 213 to 215, the opponent's moves varied, with a loss in round 215 when they played rock against my scissors.
   - From rounds 216 to 245, the opponent's moves seem to vary, with some rounds resulting in ties and others in wins or losses for me.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning in round 211, the opponent repeated the same move (scissors) in round 212.
   - After losing in round 213, the opponent switched from scissors to rock in round 215.
   - After a tie in round 216, the opponent played rock in round 217, which I beat with paper in round 218.
   - After winning in round 219, the opponent switched to paper in round 220, which I beat with scissors.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to change based on the outcome of the previous round. They often repeat the same move after a win, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and sometimes play a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.
   - This behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely the one described above. Here is the strategy in the required format:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, their next play is likely to be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7170566471053684, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter this, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch to counter moves.
   - For example, in round 211, the opponent played 'scissors' after I played 'paper', resulting in their win. In round 212, they repeated 'scissors', which suggests a pattern of repeating the winning move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the winning move (e.g., rounds 211 and 212).
   - After a loss, they seem to switch to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 215, they lost with 'scissors' and switched to 'rock' in round 216).
   - After a tie, they sometimes repeat the same move (e.g., rounds 216 and 217).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."
   - This strategy explains the observed moves, especially the repetition after wins and the switch after losses.

Given this analysis, the opponent's strategy is most likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie and they played paper, their next move is likely to be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's plays seem to be reactive to the previous round's outcome and possibly the moves involved.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move or plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's response varies, sometimes repeating their move or playing a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This doesn't consistently match the observed behavior, as the opponent doesn't always play the counter to their last move.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This also doesn't consistently match the observed behavior.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't match the observed behavior, as the opponent doesn't always counter my last move.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't match the observed behavior, as the opponent doesn't always mirror my last move.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move. After a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move. After a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last move.
     - This strategy partially matches the observed behavior but not consistently.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last move. After a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last move. After a tie, they play the same move.
     - This strategy partially matches the observed behavior but not consistently.
   - **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
     - This strategy is complex and seems to account for the variability in the opponent's responses, considering both the outcome and the transition.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, Strategy 7 seems to best explain the opponent's behavior, as it accounts for different transitions based on both the outcome and the previous transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and won against the opponent's rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (rock vs. paper), they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round, I should play scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, we need to analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided. Let's break down the patterns:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For example, after a loss, they often switch to a move that would beat their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's response varies, sometimes repeating their move or switching to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategy:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they adjust their move based on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically, after a win, they might repeat or switch to a move that would beat their last move. After a loss, they switch to a move that would beat their last move. After a tie, they might repeat or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- **After a win:** The opponent plays the same move or the move that would beat their last round's move.
- **After a loss:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- **After a tie:** The opponent plays the same move or the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This aligns with the strategy described as:
"After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Therefore, the selected strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For example, when I played 'scissors' and they played 'rock' (round 251), they won and repeated 'rock' in the next round (round 252).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their move. For instance, in rounds 250 and 251, they won with 'rock' against my 'scissors' and repeated 'rock'.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move. For example, in round 238, they lost with 'paper' against my 'rock', and in round 239, they played 'scissors'.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less clear, but they sometimes repeat their move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains the observed behavior: repeating moves after a win, switching to a winning move after a loss, and sometimes switching to a losing move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies provided.

1. **Identify Patterns:**
   - The opponent's moves in response to my moves have been varied, but there are some noticeable patterns.
   - For instance, when I played 'paper' and won against 'rock' (round 252), the opponent played 'rock' again in the next round (round 253), which suggests a pattern of repeating moves after a loss.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win: The opponent sometimes repeats the move that won, but there are instances where they switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss: The opponent often repeats the move they lost with, which is not typical for a strategy that changes based on losses.
   - After a tie: There are instances where the opponent repeats the move, but also instances where they switch to a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to partially fit, but not completely, as the opponent doesn't consistently follow this pattern.
   - The strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." is complex and considers multiple factors, which might explain the varied responses observed.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the last strategy seems to best capture the observed behavior, as it accounts for both the outcome and the transition made by the opponent.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'paper' and my opponent played 'rock', resulting in a win for me. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'rock' last, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7599, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the patterns in their behavior based on the interaction history provided.

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves after a win, loss, or tie seem to vary, suggesting a more complex strategy than simply repeating or changing based on the last move.
   - The opponent's response does not consistently align with playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move, nor does it consistently align with playing the move that would beat or lose to my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - **Wins**: 
     - After winning (e.g., round 208, 209, 210), the opponent doesn't consistently play the same move or the move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses**:
     - After losing (e.g., round 211, 212, 215), the opponent's next move doesn't consistently beat their last move, suggesting they don't strictly follow a pattern of changing to beat their last move.
   - **Ties**:
     - After ties (e.g., round 216, 223, 226), the opponent's next move doesn't consistently lose to or repeat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be influenced by both the outcome of the previous round and potentially the transition they made in the previous round.
   - The complex strategy described in the last option seems to fit the observed behavior, as it accounts for different responses based on both the outcome and the transition made.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is the complex one described in the last option. This strategy considers both the outcome of the previous round and the transition made, which aligns with the variability and complexity observed in the opponent's moves.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the last few rounds. In round 254, I played 'rock' and the opponent played 'scissors', resulting in my win. In round 255, I played 'paper' and the opponent played 'scissors', resulting in my loss. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent's move would lose to my move two rounds ago, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss where the opponent's move would beat my move two rounds ago, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves don't consistently follow a pattern of beating, losing to, or copying my last move. For instance, in round 256, they played 'paper' after I played 'paper', resulting in a tie.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie in round 256, the opponent played 'paper' again, which is the same move as the previous round. This suggests they might be repeating their move after a tie.
   - After a loss in round 255, where they played 'scissors' against my 'paper', they played 'paper' in the next round, which would lose to their previous move. This aligns with a strategy of playing the move that would lose to their last move after a loss.
   - After a win in round 254, where they played 'scissors' against my 'rock', they played 'scissors' again in the next round, which is the same move as their previous round. This suggests they might repeat their move after a win.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win or a tie, and play the move that would lose to their last move after a loss. This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie and they played 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After losing, the opponent often plays a move that would beat their last move. For example, in round 257, they played 'rock' after losing with 'rock' in round 256.
   - After winning, they sometimes repeat the same move, such as in rounds 208-209 and 210-211.
   - After ties, their behavior seems less predictable, but they sometimes play a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, they often play the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, they sometimes play the move that would lose to their last move or repeat their move.

3. **Matching Strategy:**
   - The strategy that best matches this behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains the observed behavior, where the opponent's move depends on the outcome of the previous round. They tend to repeat moves after a win, adjust to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and sometimes play a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they won with 'rock'. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they play a move that beats their previous move or loses to it. This suggests they might be following a pattern based on their previous move or the outcome.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's response varies, sometimes repeating the move or switching to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to align with some of the observed behaviors, but not consistently.
   - The strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." is complex and considers both the outcome and the transition, which might explain the variability in the opponent's moves.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's moves, the last strategy seems to best account for the observed behavior. It considers both the outcome and the transition, which aligns with the opponent's inconsistent but patterned responses.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent's next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter move is 'scissors' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently follow a pattern of beating or losing to their last move. For example, in round 259, the opponent played 'scissors' after playing 'rock' in round 258, which doesn't fit the pattern of playing a move that beats or loses to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - The opponent's behavior does seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For instance:
     - After a tie in round 223 (both played 'scissors'), the opponent played 'paper' in round 224, which would lose to their last move 'scissors'.
     - After a win in round 228 (opponent played 'rock' against my 'scissors'), the opponent played 'rock' again in round 229, which is the same move as the last round.
     - After a loss in round 232 (opponent played 'rock' against my 'scissors'), the opponent played 'rock' again in round 233, which is the same move as the last round.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits the observed behavior is the one where:
     - After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
     - After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This strategy aligns with the observed moves and outcomes in the interaction history. Therefore, the opponent is likely using the following strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {228: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.31734731358931345, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and match it against the possible strategies provided:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's response varies, but there seems to be a tendency to play the move that would lose to their last round's move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **After a Loss:** The opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last move. For example, in round 215, the opponent played 'rock' after losing with 'scissors' in round 214.
   - **After a Win:** The opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays the move that would beat their last round's move. For instance, in round 213, after winning with 'rock' against 'scissors', they played 'rock' again in round 214.
   - **After a Tie:** The opponent's behavior is less predictable, but there are instances where they play the move that would lose to their last move. For example, in round 223, after a tie with 'scissors', they played 'scissors' again in round 224.

3. **Matching with Strategies:**
   - The strategy that best fits the observed behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy aligns with the observed pattern of the opponent's moves changing based on the outcome of the previous round, particularly the tendency to play the move that would beat their last move after a loss and sometimes repeating their move after a win or tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my previous plays. For example, when I played 'scissors' and lost to 'rock', the opponent repeated 'rock' in the next round.
   - There are instances where the opponent's move beats my previous move, suggesting a pattern where they might be trying to counter my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their winning move (e.g., round 213 to 214, opponent played 'scissors' after winning with 'scissors').
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat my last move (e.g., round 215 to 216, opponent switched from 'rock' to 'paper' after losing).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., round 223 to 224, opponent played 'scissors' again after a tie).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they react based on the outcome of the previous round. Specifically, they tend to repeat a winning move, switch to a counter move after a loss, and sometimes repeat the same move after a tie.
   - This behavior is consistent with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be influenced by my previous moves, as they often play moves that would beat or lose to my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their winning move or play a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the same move or a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with a strategy where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and their previous transition.
   - Specifically, after a win, they might repeat the move or play a move that beats their last move. After a loss, they often play a move that beats their last move. After a tie, they might repeat the move or play a move that loses to their last move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is the one where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This strategy accounts for the variability in their responses based on the outcome of the previous round and their previous move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and won against the opponent's rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors), they will play the same move as they did in the last round, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8852665629949559, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {228: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3437806158675284, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent seems to frequently play the move that would beat my previous move. For instance, when I played 'paper' in round 267, they played 'scissors', which beats 'paper'.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats the move that would beat my previous move, suggesting a pattern.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the move that would beat my last move, indicating a tendency to stick with a winning strategy.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat my last move, suggesting an adaptive strategy.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes switch to a move that would beat my last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior. The opponent frequently chooses a move that would beat my previous move, indicating a predictive and adaptive strategy.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'paper' in the last round, I predict their next play will be 'scissors' to beat my 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently beat or lose to their own previous moves, which rules out the first two strategies.
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently beat my last move, which rules out the third strategy.
   - The opponent does not consistently repeat my last move, which rules out the fourth strategy.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, sometimes changes to a move that would beat their last move, and sometimes changes to a move that would lose to their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, sometimes changes to a move that would beat their last move, and sometimes changes to a move that would lose to their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, sometimes changes to a move that would beat their last move, and sometimes changes to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be influenced by both the outcome of the previous round and the transition they made in that round. This aligns with the most complex strategy described, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is the last one, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'rock' and won against the opponent's 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (which was 'paper'), they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', I should play 'paper' to counter it and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.
   - For example, in round 269, the opponent played 'rock' after playing 'scissors' in round 268. This suggests a possible pattern of playing a move that would beat their last move, but this is not consistent throughout.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior varies, sometimes repeating the same move or switching to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently match a single simple strategy. However, the complexity and variability in their responses suggest a more intricate strategy.
   - The strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the transition made by the opponent in the last round seems to fit the observed behavior. This strategy accounts for different responses based on whether the opponent won, lost, or tied, and how they transitioned from the previous round.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy is described as:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior after a win, loss, or tie suggests a mixed strategy that depends on the outcome of the previous round.
   - The opponent sometimes repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.

Based on these observations, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the following strategy:

- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This strategy best explains the observed moves, as it accounts for the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and switch to a losing move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to play paper next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Analyzing Patterns:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less predictable but sometimes chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent tends to repeat their move or choose a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses:** The opponent tends to choose a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** The opponent sometimes chooses a move that would lose to their last move or repeats their move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to match the observed behavior.
   - This strategy predicts repeating moves after wins, choosing a winning move after losses, and choosing a losing move after ties, which aligns with the observed patterns.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior.
   - This strategy predicts that after a win, the opponent might repeat their move, which aligns with some rounds. After a loss, they switch to a move that would beat their last move, which is consistent with several rounds. After a tie, they sometimes switch to a move that would lose to their last move, which also matches some rounds.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played scissors and lost to my rock), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies provided.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my previous moves. For instance, when I played 'rock' and won, they often played 'scissors' in the next round, which is beaten by 'rock'.
   - When I played 'paper' and won, they often played 'rock' in the next round, which is beaten by 'paper'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last move. For example, if they played 'rock' and lost, they play 'paper' next.
   - After a loss, they seem to play the move that would lose to their last move. For example, if they played 'scissors' and lost, they play 'rock' next.
   - After a tie, they seem to play the same move again.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy accurately predicts the opponent's observed moves based on the interaction history. Therefore, the opponent is likely using this strategy.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it would lose to 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7599, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played paper and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their move.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's plays are: rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock.
   - There seems to be a pattern where the opponent frequently plays "rock" after playing "scissors" and "paper" after playing "rock".

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After winning with "rock" against "scissors", the opponent plays "rock" again.
   - After losing with "rock" against "paper", the opponent switches to "paper".
   - After tying with "rock" against "rock", the opponent switches to "paper".
   - After winning with "paper" against "rock", the opponent plays "paper" again.
   - After losing with "scissors" against "rock", the opponent switches to "rock".

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent seems to play the same move after a win.
   - The opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.
   - The opponent seems to switch to a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.

Based on these observations, the opponent's behavior aligns with the following strategy:

- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This strategy matches the observed behavior in the interaction history.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since the opponent won the last round with 'rock', their likely play in the next round is 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it against the possible strategies.

1. **Analyzing Patterns:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round (win, lose, or tie).
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win, and other times they switch to a move that would beat their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win: The opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 230 to 231: opponent played paper after winning with paper) and sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 229 to 230: opponent played paper after winning with rock).
   - After a loss: The opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 232 to 233: opponent played rock after losing with scissors).
   - After a tie: The opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 231 to 232: opponent played paper after a tie with paper) and sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior:
     - After wins, the opponent often repeats their move.
     - After losses, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last move.
     - After ties, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary based on the outcome of the previous round (win, loss, tie).
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their last move after a win, but not consistently.
   - After losses, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would beat their last move, but again, not consistently.
   - After ties, the opponent's behavior is less predictable.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent sometimes repeats their move, but other times they switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses:** The opponent sometimes plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** The opponent's response to ties is inconsistent, sometimes repeating their move or switching to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently match a single simple strategy like always playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move.
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be influenced by both the outcome of the previous round and possibly the transition they made in the previous round.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the strategy that best fits is the one that considers both the outcome and the transition made in the previous round. This strategy accounts for the observed variability and conditional behavior based on both the outcome and the previous transition.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played scissors and won against the opponent's paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (paper vs. scissors), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9717524751, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter their move and win the round.

  'my_next_play': 'rock'

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9988601104814627, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.", 'value': 0.0476904100349661, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 213: {'value': 0.045899999999999996, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays the move that would beat my last move, but this is not consistent enough to suggest a simple pattern.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, but not always.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit some of the observed behavior.
   - However, the more complex strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to fit better, as it accounts for the variability in the opponent's moves.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the strategy that best explains their actions is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the different responses after wins, losses, and ties, and matches the observed behavior more accurately.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and the opponent played 'rock', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently follow a pattern of playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move or my last move. This rules out the first four strategies.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move and sometimes changes it. This inconsistency suggests they are not strictly following a pattern of repeating or changing their move after a win.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move, but not consistently enough to fit a simple pattern.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move and sometimes changes it, which doesn't fit a simple pattern either.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be influenced by both the outcome of the previous round and the transition they made in that round. This suggests a more complex strategy that considers both the outcome and the transition type.
   - The last strategy described in the prompt, which considers both the previous outcome and the transition type, seems to fit the observed behavior best. This strategy accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses after wins, losses, and ties.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the last one, which considers both the previous outcome and the transition type.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter-move is paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played paper, so according to their strategy, they would play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
