To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the given interaction history:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Result: Tie

Given the strategies listed, let's evaluate which one fits the observed behavior:

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - If the opponent played paper in round 0, they would play scissors in round 1. This doesn't fit the observed behavior.

- **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - If the opponent played paper in round 0, they would play rock in round 1. This doesn't fit the observed behavior.

- **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - If the opponent played paper in round 0, they would play scissors in round 1 to beat my paper. This doesn't fit the observed behavior.

- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - If the opponent played paper in round 0, they would play paper in round 1. This fits the observed behavior.

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - After a tie in round 0, the opponent would play rock in round 1. This doesn't fit the observed behavior.

- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - After a tie in round 0, the opponent would play paper in round 1. This fits the observed behavior.

- **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
  - This strategy is complex and requires more data to evaluate accurately.

Based on the analysis, Strategy 6 fits the observed behavior best, as the opponent played the same move (paper) after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie and they played 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the given interaction history:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Result: Tie

2. **Round 1:**

Now, let's evaluate each possible strategy:

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move:**
  - From round 0 to round 1, the opponent played Paper and then Rock. Rock does not beat Paper, so this strategy does not fit.

- **The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move:**
  - From round 0 to round 1, the opponent played Paper and then Rock. Rock does not lose to Paper, so this strategy does not fit.

- **The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move:**
  - From round 0 to round 1, the opponent played Paper and then Rock. Rock beats Scissors, which was my play in round 1. This strategy fits.

- **The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move:**
  - From round 0 to round 1, the opponent played Paper and then Rock. Rock is not the same as Scissors, so this strategy does not fit.

- **After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move:**
  - In round 0, there was a tie, and the opponent played Paper. In round 1, they played Rock, which does not lose to Paper. This strategy does not fit.

- **After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round:**
  - In round 0, there was a tie, and the opponent played Paper. In round 1, they played Rock, which is not the same as Paper. This strategy does not fit.

- **Complex strategy based on previous outcomes and transitions:**
  - This strategy is complex and requires more data to evaluate accurately. Based on the limited data, it is difficult to determine if this strategy fits.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior so far is: "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move."

```python

```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move, and I last played scissors, I believe their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter this.

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - Result: Tie

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Result: I lost

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Result: I won

Now, let's evaluate the possible strategies:

- **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - Round 1: Opponent played Rock, which would beat Paper (their last move was Paper). This matches.
  - Round 2: Opponent played Rock again, which does not match this strategy as it should have been Paper to beat Rock.

- **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - Round 1: Opponent played Rock, which does not lose to Paper (their last move was Paper).
  - Round 2: Opponent played Rock again, which does not lose to Rock.

- **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - Round 1: Opponent played Rock, which beats Scissors (my last move was Paper). This matches.
  - Round 2: Opponent played Rock, which beats Paper (my last move was Scissors). This does not match.

- **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - Round 1: Opponent played Rock, which does not match my last move (Paper).
  - Round 2: Opponent played Rock, which does not match my last move (Scissors).

- **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - Round 1: Opponent lost (played Rock), and they played Rock again, which matches the strategy.
  - Round 2: Opponent lost (played Rock), and they played Rock again, which matches the strategy.

- **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - Round 1: Opponent lost (played Rock), and they played Rock again, which does not match the strategy.
  - Round 2: Opponent lost (played Rock), and they played Rock again, which does not match the strategy.

- **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
  - This strategy is too complex to match with only three rounds of data.

Based on the analysis, Strategy 5 seems to match the opponent's behavior in rounds 1 and 2. Therefore, the opponent is likely using Strategy 5.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move"

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Result: Tie

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Result: I lost

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Result: I won

4. **Round 3:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Result: I won

**Analysis:**

- **Round 0 to Round 1:**
  - After a tie, the opponent switched from Paper to Rock.
  - This could align with the strategy where after a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (Paper -> Rock).

- **Round 1 to Round 2:**
  - After a win (opponent's win), the opponent played the same move (Rock).
  - This aligns with the strategy where after a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

- **Round 2 to Round 3:**
  - After a loss (opponent's loss), the opponent switched from Rock to Paper.
  - This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (Rock -> Paper).

**Conclusion:**

The opponent's behavior seems to align with the following strategy:
- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This strategy accurately predicts the opponent's moves based on the observed history.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost, so they are likely to play 'scissors' next to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 4: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze each round:

1. **Round 0**: 
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Result: Tie
   - Next move by opponent (Round 1): Rock

2. **Round 1**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Result: Opponent wins
   - Next move by opponent (Round 2): Rock

3. **Round 2**: 
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Result: I win
   - Next move by opponent (Round 3): Paper

4. **Round 3**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Result: I win
   - Next move by opponent (Round 4): Scissors

5. **Round 4**: 
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Result: I win
   - Next move by opponent (Round 5): Unknown

Now, let's evaluate the strategies:

- **Strategy 1**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent played Rock after Paper (Round 0 to 1), which doesn't beat Paper.

- **Strategy 2**: The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent played Rock after Paper (Round 0 to 1), which doesn't lose to Paper.

- **Strategy 3**: The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
  - This fits for Round 1 to 2 (Rock beats Scissors) and Round 3 to 4 (Scissors beats Paper).

- **Strategy 4**: The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
  - This fits for Round 2 to 3 (Paper) and Round 4 to 5 (Scissors).

- **Strategy 5**: After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent didn't play the same move after winning in Round 1.

- **Strategy 6**: After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
  - This doesn't fit as the opponent didn't play the move that would beat their last move after winning in Round 1.

- **Strategy 7**: The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.
  - This is complex and doesn't clearly fit the observed pattern.

The most consistent strategy with the observed behavior is Strategy 3: The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move, and my last play was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'paper' to beat my 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 4: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Result: Tie
   - Next move by opponent: Rock (Round 1)

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Result: Opponent wins
   - Next move by opponent: Rock (Round 2)

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Result: I win
   - Next move by opponent: Paper (Round 3)

4. **Round 3:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Paper
   - Result: I win
   - Next move by opponent: Scissors (Round 4)

5. **Round 4:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent play: Scissors
   - Result: I win
   - Next move by opponent: Rock (Round 5)

6. **Round 5:**
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent play: Rock
   - Result: Opponent wins

Now, let's analyze the patterns:

- After a tie in Round 0, the opponent played Rock in Round 1. This could align with the strategy where after a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (Paper -> Rock).
  
- After winning in Round 1, the opponent repeated Rock in Round 2. This aligns with the strategy where after a win, the opponent plays the same move.

- After losing in Round 2, the opponent played Paper in Round 3. This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (Rock -> Paper).

- After losing in Round 3, the opponent played Scissors in Round 4. This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (Paper -> Scissors).

- After losing in Round 4, the opponent played Rock in Round 5. This aligns with the strategy where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move (Scissors -> Rock).

- After winning in Round 5, the opponent repeated Rock in Round 6. This aligns with the strategy where after a win, the opponent plays the same move.

The strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted 'rock' play, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.99321776927151, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost, so they are likely to play scissors next to beat their previous move.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

User Message: 
            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 20, {'round': 19, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

20. **Round 19**: Loss (Scissors vs. Rock)
    - Opponent plays Rock in Round 20.
    - Possible strategies: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

The opponent's behavior seems to align most consistently with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In round 19, the opponent played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 6, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 7, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 9, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 10, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 11, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 12, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 13, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 14, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 15, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 16, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 17, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 18, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 19, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 20, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}].

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent has played 'rock' 8 times, 'paper' 0 times, and 'scissors' 13 times.
   - The opponent's moves seem to be heavily skewed towards 'rock' and 'scissors', with no instances of 'paper'.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win (rounds 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20), the opponent tends to repeat the winning move or switch to another move that beats their previous move.
   - After a loss (rounds 1, 5, 19), the opponent switches to a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After a tie (round 0), the opponent switched to a move that would beat their previous move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to switch moves after a loss and to repeat or switch to a winning move after a win.

Based on the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it would lose to 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7934020773370238, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' next to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best move to counter this would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they play the same move after a win, the move that would beat their last move after a loss, and the move that would lose to their last move after a tie. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play the move that beats 'rock', which is 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move is 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9916630286218419, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost, so they are likely to play 'scissors' next to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Round 0:** Both played 'paper', resulting in a tie. 
2. **Round 1:** I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock', opponent won.
3. **Round 2:** I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock', I won.
4. **Round 3:** I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper', I won.
5. **Round 4:** I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors', I won.
6. **Round 5:** I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock', opponent won.
7. **Round 6:** I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock', I won.
8. **Round 7:** I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper', I won.
9. **Round 8:** I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors', I won.
10. **Round 9:** I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock', I won.
11. **Round 10:** I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper', I won.
12. **Round 11:** I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors', I won.
13. **Round 12:** I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock', I won.
14. **Round 13:** I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper', I won.
15. **Round 14:** I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors', I won.
16. **Round 15:** I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock', I won.
17. **Round 16:** I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper', I won.
18. **Round 17:** I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors', I won.
19. **Round 18:** I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock', I won.
20. **Round 19:** I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock', opponent won.
21. **Round 20:** I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock', I won.
22. **Round 21:** I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper', opponent won.
23. **Round 22:** I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper', I won.
24. **Round 23:** I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors', I won.
25. **Round 24:** I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock', I won.
26. **Round 25:** I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper', I won.
27. **Round 26:** I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors', I won.
28. **Round 27:** I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock', I won.
29. **Round 28:** I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper', I won.
30. **Round 29:** I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors', I won.
31. **Round 30:** I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock', I won.
32. **Round 31:** I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper', I won.
33. **Round 32:** Both played 'rock', resulting in a tie.

**Analysis:**

- The opponent seems to frequently play 'rock' after losing or tying, which suggests a pattern.
- After a win, the opponent often plays the same move again.
- After a loss, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

Given these observations, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the strategy:

"After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Thus, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Tie (Paper vs. Paper)
   - Next move: Rock (beats Paper)

2. **Round 1**: Loss (Scissors vs. Rock)
   - Next move: Rock (beats Scissors)

3. **Round 2**: Win (Paper vs. Rock)
   - Next move: Paper (same as last move)

4. **Round 3**: Win (Scissors vs. Paper)
   - Next move: Scissors (same as last move)

5. **Round 4**: Win (Rock vs. Scissors)
   - Next move: Scissors (loses to Rock)

6. **Round 5**: Loss (Scissors vs. Rock)
   - Next move: Paper (beats Rock)

7. **Round 6**: Win (Paper vs. Rock)
   - Next move: Paper (same as last move)

8. **Round 7**: Win (Scissors vs. Paper)
   - Next move: Scissors (same as last move)

9. **Round 8**: Win (Rock vs. Scissors)
   - Next move: Rock (same as last move)

10. **Round 9**: Win (Paper vs. Rock)
    - Next move: Paper (same as last move)

11. **Round 10**: Win (Scissors vs. Paper)
    - Next move: Scissors (same as last move)

12. **Round 11**: Win (Rock vs. Scissors)
    - Next move: Rock (same as last move)

13. **Round 12**: Win (Paper vs. Rock)
    - Next move: Paper (same as last move)

14. **Round 13**: Win (Scissors vs. Paper)
    - Next move: Scissors (same as last move)

15. **Round 14**: Win (Rock vs. Scissors)
    - Next move: Rock (same as last move)

16. **Round 15**: Win (Paper vs. Rock)
    - Next move: Paper (same as last move)

17. **Round 16**: Win (Scissors vs. Paper)
    - Next move: Scissors (same as last move)

18. **Round 17**: Win (Rock vs. Scissors)
    - Next move: Rock (same as last move)

19. **Round 18**: Win (Paper vs. Rock)
    - Next move: Paper (same as last move)

20. **Round 19**: Loss (Scissors vs. Rock)
    - Next move: Rock (beats Scissors)

21. **Round 20**: Win (Paper vs. Rock)
    - Next move: Paper (same as last move)

22. **Round 21**: Loss (Rock vs. Paper)
    - Next move: Scissors (beats Paper)

23. **Round 22**: Win (Scissors vs. Paper)
    - Next move: Scissors (same as last move)

24. **Round 23**: Win (Rock vs. Scissors)
    - Next move: Rock (same as last move)

25. **Round 24**: Win (Paper vs. Rock)
    - Next move: Paper (same as last move)

26. **Round 25**: Win (Scissors vs. Paper)
    - Next move: Scissors (same as last move)

27. **Round 26**: Win (Rock vs. Scissors)
    - Next move: Rock (same as last move)

28. **Round 27**: Win (Paper vs. Rock)
    - Next move: Paper (same as last move)

29. **Round 28**: Win (Scissors vs. Paper)
    - Next move: Scissors (same as last move)

30. **Round 29**: Win (Rock vs. Scissors)
    - Next move: Rock (same as last move)

31. **Round 30**: Win (Paper vs. Rock)
    - Next move: Paper (same as last move)

32. **Round 31**: Win (Scissors vs. Paper)
    - Next move: Scissors (same as last move)

33. **Round 32**: Tie (Rock vs. Rock)
    - Next move: Rock (same as last move)

34. **Round 33**: Win (Rock vs. Scissors)
    - Next move: ?

From this analysis, the opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss. After a tie, they seem to repeat the same move. This aligns with the strategy:

"After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Let's output this strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my next play should be paper to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best move to counter this would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock' to beat their 'scissors'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9828866358953835, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9941301161121165, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat their previous 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to beat their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat the same move or switch to a different one. For example, in rounds 0 and 1, the opponent played 'paper' and then 'rock', which beats 'scissors' (my move in round 1).
   - In rounds 1 and 2, the opponent played 'rock' and then 'rock' again, which lost to my 'paper' in round 2.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie in round 0, the opponent switched from 'paper' to 'rock', which beats 'scissors' (my move in round 1).
   - After losing in round 1, the opponent repeated 'rock' in round 2, which lost again to my 'paper'.
   - After winning in round 3, the opponent switched from 'paper' to 'scissors', which lost to my 'rock' in round 4.
   - After winning in round 4, the opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'rock', which lost to my 'paper' in round 5.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently align with playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move.
   - The opponent does not consistently play the move that would beat or lose to my last move.
   - The opponent does not consistently repeat their last move after a win or switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This is evident from the mixed responses after wins, losses, and ties.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the complex strategy where the opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played rock, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter-move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent's moves are: paper, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, scissors, scissors.
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently follow a pattern of playing the move that beats or loses to their last move.

2. **Response to Wins, Losses, and Ties**:
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., after winning with rock against scissors, they play rock again).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., after losing with rock against paper, they play paper).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would lose to their last move (e.g., after tying with rock, they play scissors).

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - The opponent does not consistently follow a single pattern but seems to adjust based on the outcome (win, lose, tie).

4. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" does not fully match the observed behavior.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to match more closely with the observed behavior.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors, so their next play is likely to be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7050134486149634, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost, so they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock' to ensure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8988196128749325, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win or changes it after a loss or tie.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move or chooses a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to choose a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes chooses a move that would lose to their previous move.

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where their move depends on both the previous outcome and the transition they made. This is evident from the way they change their moves after wins, losses, and ties.
   - Specifically, the opponent's behavior matches the complex strategy described in the last option, where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is best described by the last option, which accounts for the nuanced transitions observed in their play.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both my opponent and I played paper, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play scissors, my best counter-move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the potential strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or change based on the outcome.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes chooses a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This doesn't consistently match the opponent's behavior.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This also doesn't consistently match the opponent's behavior.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't match the observed behavior.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't match the observed behavior.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This strategy seems to align with the observed behavior, especially after ties and losses.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
     - This doesn't match the observed behavior.
   - **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and transition.
     - This strategy is complex and doesn't seem to fit the observed behavior as closely as Strategy 5.

Based on the analysis, Strategy 5 seems to best explain the opponent's behavior so far. The opponent's moves after ties and losses align with this strategy.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves are: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, rock, scissors.
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern of repeating the sequence: scissors, rock, paper, which aligns with the strategy of playing the move that would beat their opponent's last round move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - The opponent's behavior does not seem to change based on the outcome (win, lose, or tie). They continue to follow the pattern regardless of the result.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last rounds move" fits the observed pattern. The opponent consistently plays the move that would beat my last move, indicating they are trying to counter my previous play.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'rock' last, I predict their next play will be 'paper' to beat my 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'paper' next to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move should be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9760443357299617, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {4: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.38826172450768126, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.12975779784388553, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions:

1. **Patterns in Response to Moves:**
   - The opponent has played 'rock' in the last two rounds, which resulted in ties.
   - Before these ties, the opponent played 'scissors' and 'paper', which were beaten by my 'rock' and 'scissors', respectively.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (round 21), the opponent played 'paper' again, which suggests they might repeat their move after a win.
   - After a loss (round 19), the opponent switched from 'rock' to 'rock' again, which doesn't fit a clear pattern of switching to a winning move.
   - After a tie (round 32), the opponent played 'scissors', which would beat 'rock', suggesting they might switch to a winning move after a tie.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switch to a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This aligns with the observed behavior, particularly the transitions after ties and wins.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, I should play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's last move was 'paper' after I played 'rock'. This resulted in a win for them.
   - In the previous rounds, the opponent's moves have varied, but there are some instances where they seem to repeat their move or choose a move that beats my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning (e.g., round 21, 58), the opponent's next move sometimes beats their previous move (e.g., round 22: 'scissors' beats 'paper').
   - After losing (e.g., round 20, 23), the opponent sometimes plays a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 24: 'rock' to 'scissors').
   - After ties (e.g., round 32, 48), the opponent's next move doesn't consistently follow a clear pattern.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they often play the move that would beat their last move after a loss, and sometimes repeat their move after a win. This suggests a mix of strategies.
   - The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Given the analysis, the strategy that most accurately predicts the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and won. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors next, as it beats their last move, paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From round 20 to 69, the opponent's moves seem to consistently counter my previous moves, especially when I play 'rock' and they respond with 'paper' (rounds 21, 68, 69).
   - When I play 'scissors', they often respond with 'rock' (round 58).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to continue with a move that would beat my previous move (e.g., round 21, 58).
   - After a loss, they seem to switch to a move that would beat my last move (e.g., round 58, where they lost to 'scissors' and then played 'rock').
   - After a tie, their behavior is less clear, but they sometimes repeat the move (e.g., round 67, 68).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to fit some of the patterns, but not all.
   - The strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." seems overly complex for the observed behavior.
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move" aligns well with the opponent consistently countering my previous move.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior most closely aligns with the strategy where they play the move that would beat my last round's move. This is evident from their consistent countering of my moves, especially when I play 'rock' and they respond with 'paper'.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'rock' last, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From round 21 to 70, the opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch based on outcomes.
   - For example, in round 21, they played 'paper' against my 'rock', which they won. In round 22, they played 'paper' again, which they lost to my 'scissors'.
   - In round 23, they played 'scissors' against my 'rock', which they lost. In round 24, they switched to 'rock', which they lost to my 'paper'.
   - This suggests some pattern based on the outcome of the previous round.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., rounds 21 and 22).
   - After a loss, they often switch to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 23 to 24).
   - After a tie, their behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes repeat the move (e.g., round 32 to 33).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well.
   - This strategy explains the repetition after a win and the switch after a loss. The tie behavior is less clear, but the opponent sometimes repeats or switches to a losing move.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's observed behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's plays seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat their move or choose a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 32 to 33, round 48 to 49).
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their previous move (e.g., round 68 to 69).
   - After a tie, they sometimes repeat their move (e.g., round 48 to 49).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit some of the observed behavior.
   - However, the strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." seems to capture the complexity of the opponent's behavior more accurately, as it considers both the outcome and the transition.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's moves, the latter strategy seems to best explain their behavior.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (which was 'scissors' beating 'paper'), they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play 'scissors' again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my best counter move is to play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played 'rock', resulting in a tie. According to their strategy, they should play 'scissors' next, as it would lose to their last move 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round, my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8271876036266042, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors against my rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 29 to 77, the opponent's moves seem to be consistently beaten by my moves, indicating a potential pattern.
   - In round 78, the opponent played 'rock' after I played 'scissors' in round 77, which beat my move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - The opponent's behavior after a win, loss, or tie needs to be examined.
   - After a loss (round 58), the opponent played 'rock' against my 'scissors' in round 59, which suggests they might be trying to beat their last move.
   - After a win (round 68), the opponent played 'paper' again in round 69, suggesting they might repeat their move after a win.
   - After a tie (round 67), the opponent played 'paper' in round 68, which would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they repeat their move after a win, try to beat their last move after a loss, and play the move that would lose to their last move after a tie.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:
- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This strategy is consistent with the observed moves and outcomes in the history provided.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted play of 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to ensure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent frequently plays 'rock' when I play 'paper' and 'scissors', suggesting they might be trying to counter my moves.
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive rather than random.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After losing (e.g., round 78), the opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper', which they lost to in the previous round.
   - After winning (e.g., round 68 and 69), the opponent played 'paper' twice, which suggests they might be sticking to a winning move.
   - After ties (e.g., round 48 and 49), the opponent repeated the move, indicating they might not change their strategy after a tie.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play the same move after a win and sometimes after a tie.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move.

Based on these observations, the opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy:
"After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after wins and ties and change moves after losses.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played rock and I played paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's plays after each round need to be examined to see if they follow a consistent pattern.
   - We should check if the opponent's move is influenced by their previous move, my previous move, or the outcome of the previous round.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** When the opponent wins, do they repeat their move, change it, or choose a move based on my previous move?
   - **Losses:** When the opponent loses, do they switch to a move that would have beaten my last move, or do they follow another pattern?
   - **Ties:** After a tie, does the opponent repeat their move, or do they choose a different strategy?

3. **Strategy Matching:**
   - Let's compare the observed behavior with each strategy:

   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This would mean if they played 'rock' last, they would play 'paper' next. This doesn't consistently match the history.

   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This would mean if they played 'rock' last, they would play 'scissors' next. This doesn't consistently match the history.

   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This would mean if I played 'rock' last, they would play 'paper' next. This doesn't consistently match the history.

   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This would mean if I played 'rock' last, they would play 'rock' next. This doesn't consistently match the history.

   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This strategy seems to match some of the behavior observed, especially the change after losses.

   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
     - This strategy doesn't consistently match the history.

   - **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and transition.
     - This strategy is complex and might match the observed behavior, but it requires more detailed analysis.

Based on the analysis, Strategy 5 seems to align most closely with the observed behavior, especially regarding changes after wins and losses. The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and change it after a loss.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played scissors and won against their paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played paper last round, they are likely to play scissors in the next round to beat paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round, I should play rock to counter their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.782264269970888, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves have been consistent with certain patterns, especially after specific outcomes (win, loss, tie).
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win, changes their move after a loss, and sometimes repeats or changes after a tie.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - **Wins**: The opponent often repeats their move after a win, which aligns with the strategy where they play the same move after a win.
   - **Losses**: After a loss, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last move, suggesting a strategy where they adapt to counter their previous losing move.
   - **Ties**: After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move, indicating a strategy where they switch to a losing move after a tie.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The strategy that best fits the observed behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

This strategy explains the opponent's behavior in the history provided, as it accounts for their tendency to repeat moves after wins, adapt after losses, and sometimes switch to a losing move after ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on my previous understanding of the opponent's strategy, after a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie and both played paper, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's moves are consistently beaten by my moves, indicating a possible predictable pattern.
   - The opponent's moves do not seem to be random, as there are repeated instances where I win with the same sequence of moves.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win, the opponent does not seem to change their move to counter my previous winning move.
   - After a loss, the opponent does not consistently switch to a move that would beat my last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent does not consistently switch to a move that would beat my last move.

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The opponent's moves do not align with the strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, as they consistently lose.
   - The opponent's moves do not align with the strategy of playing the move that would lose to their last round's move, as they do not consistently lose in a predictable manner.
   - The opponent's moves do not align with the strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, as they do not consistently win.
   - The opponent's moves do not align with the strategy of playing the same move as my last round's move, as they do not consistently tie.
   - The opponent's moves do not align with the strategy of changing behavior based on win/loss/tie outcomes, as there is no consistent pattern observed in their responses to different outcomes.

Given the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to align most closely with the strategy where they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. This is because they consistently lose to my moves, indicating they might be playing a move that is countered by their previous move.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move, and their last move was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'scissors' because scissors would lose to rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's last move was 'paper' when I played 'rock', resulting in my loss. This could suggest they are playing a move that beats my previous move.
   - However, looking at the broader history, there are instances where they played 'rock' after I played 'scissors' (round 58), which would suggest a move that beats my previous move, but also instances where they played 'rock' after I played 'paper' (round 78), which would lose to my previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 68), the opponent played 'paper' again in round 69, which is the same move as the previous round. This suggests they might repeat their move after a win.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 58), they switched from 'rock' to 'paper' in round 59, which beats their previous move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 82), they played 'rock' in round 83, which beats their previous move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and switch to a move that beats their last move after a tie. This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and switch to a move that beats their last move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played paper and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8193451558540071, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat their previous 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9380353884579244, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.978746138241068, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat their previous 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Response to Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves after ties, wins, and losses need to be examined to see if there is a consistent pattern.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - **After Wins:** 
     - Round 45: Opponent played scissors and lost (my rock), then played rock (would beat scissors).
     - Round 46: Opponent played rock and lost (my paper), then played paper (would beat rock).
     - Round 47: Opponent played paper and lost (my scissors), then played scissors (would beat paper).
     - This suggests that after a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last move.
   - **After Losses:**
     - Round 68: Opponent played paper and won (my rock), then played paper again.
     - Round 69: Opponent played paper and won (my rock), then played paper again.
     - This suggests that after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last move.
   - **After Ties:**
     - Round 48: Opponent played rock and tied (my rock), then played scissors (would lose to rock).
     - Round 49: Opponent played scissors and tied (my scissors), then played paper (would lose to scissors).
     - This suggests that after a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains the opponent's moves accurately based on the observed patterns.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to play paper next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior.

1. **Round 94 to 95:**
   - Round 94: Opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a tie.
   - Round 95: Opponent played 'paper', which is the move that would lose to their last round's move ('scissors').

2. **Round 93 to 94:**
   - Round 93: Opponent played 'rock', resulting in a loss.
   - Round 94: Opponent played 'scissors', which is the move that would beat their last round's move ('rock').

3. **Round 92 to 93:**
   - Round 92: Opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a loss.
   - Round 93: Opponent played 'rock', which is the move that would beat their last round's move ('scissors').

4. **Round 91 to 92:**
   - Round 91: Opponent played 'paper', resulting in a loss.
   - Round 92: Opponent played 'scissors', which is the move that would beat their last round's move ('paper').

5. **Round 90 to 91:**
   - Round 90: Opponent played 'rock', resulting in a loss.
   - Round 91: Opponent played 'paper', which is the move that would beat their last round's move ('rock').

From the above analysis, we observe that after a loss, the opponent consistently plays the move that would beat their last round's move. This pattern aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Let's confirm this with the tie scenario:
- After a tie in round 94, the opponent played 'paper' in round 95, which would lose to their last round's move ('scissors').

This behavior matches the described strategy. Therefore, the opponent's strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move"
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8534395044179235, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9497297500153478, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost, so they are likely to play rock next to beat scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.995860028751689, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper to win the round.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing with scissors in the last round, they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is rock.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9995129365226074, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to ensure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my previous plays, but not in a straightforward manner. For instance, when I played 'rock' and they played 'scissors', they didn't consistently switch to 'rock' to counter my 'scissors' in the next round.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent doesn't consistently repeat their winning move or switch to a move that would beat my last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent doesn't consistently switch to a move that would beat my last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is not consistent with playing the same move again or switching to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's moves don't consistently align with any simple reactive strategy based on their last move or my last move.
   - The most complex strategy, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition, seems to fit the observed behavior better. This strategy involves the opponent's transition depending on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition they made.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to best explain their behavior. This strategy accounts for the observed variability and lack of straightforward patterns.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Since they played 'paper' in the last round, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent has played paper in the last two rounds, and they seem to have a tendency to repeat their successful plays. Given this pattern, I predict that their next play will likely be paper again.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent has played 'paper' against my 'rock' multiple times, resulting in my loss.
   - The opponent has played 'scissors' against my 'paper' multiple times, resulting in my loss.
   - The opponent has played 'rock' against my 'scissors' multiple times, resulting in my loss.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the move that won.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains the observed behavior where the opponent repeats a winning move, switches to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that loses to their last move after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors next to beat their previous move of paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

2. **Identifying Patterns:**
   - The opponent frequently plays 'rock' regardless of the previous outcome.
   - There is no clear pattern of changing moves based on wins, losses, or ties.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be heavily biased towards playing 'rock'.

3. **Matching with Strategies:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not align with any complex strategy that changes based on the previous outcome or move.
   - The opponent seems to be using a very simple strategy, possibly playing 'rock' consistently.

Given the analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be playing 'rock' consistently, which doesn't fit any of the complex strategies provided. However, if we must choose from the given options, the closest match would be a strategy that doesn't change based on the previous outcome or move, which isn't explicitly listed.

Since none of the provided strategies accurately describe the opponent's behavior, we can conclude that the opponent is using a simple strategy of consistently playing 'rock'.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent consistently plays rock regardless of the previous outcome or move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the potential strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be consistently beaten by my moves, suggesting they might be using a predictable pattern.
   - For example, in round 119, the opponent played 'rock' and I played 'paper', which beat them.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - The opponent's behavior doesn't seem to change drastically based on the outcome (win, loss, or tie).
   - For instance, after losing in round 116 with 'paper' against my 'rock', they played 'scissors' in round 117, which I beat with 'rock'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play moves that are consistently beaten by my moves, suggesting they might be using a strategy that doesn't adapt well to my plays.
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" fits this pattern, as it would consistently result in their moves being beaten by mine.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would lose to their last round's move, and considering that they played 'rock' last round, their next move is likely to be 'scissors' (since scissors would lose to rock).

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the provided interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Analyzing Patterns:**
   - The opponent's plays after each round are crucial to understanding their strategy.
   - We need to check if the opponent's move is based on their last move, my last move, or the outcome (win, lose, tie).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, loss, or tie, does the opponent change their move?
   - Specifically, we need to see if they repeat their move, switch to a move that beats or loses to their last move, or if they mimic my last move.

3. **Strategy Comparison:**
   - The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - The opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move.
   - The opponent plays the same move as my last round's move.
   - After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
   - The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

- **Round 120:** My play was 'rock', opponent's play was 'rock', resulting in a tie.
- **Round 119:** My play was 'paper', opponent's play was 'rock', resulting in my win.
- **Round 118:** My play was 'rock', opponent's play was 'scissors', resulting in my win.
- **Round 117:** My play was 'scissors', opponent's play was 'paper', resulting in my win.

From the recent rounds, we observe:
- After a tie in round 120, the opponent played 'rock' again, which is the same move.
- After a win in round 119, the opponent played 'rock', which is the same move.
- After a win in round 118, the opponent played 'rock', which is the same move.

This pattern suggests that the opponent tends to repeat their move after a win or a tie. This aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both my opponent and I played rock, resulting in a tie. According to my previous guess about their strategy, after a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the provided strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves after my plays of rock, paper, and scissors don't show a consistent pattern of directly countering my last move. For example, in round 120, both played rock, and in round 121, the opponent played scissors, which doesn't directly counter my previous rock.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (round 120 was a tie, round 121 was a win for me), the opponent played scissors, which would lose to their previous move (rock in round 120). This suggests a possible pattern of playing a move that would lose to their last move after a tie.
   - After a loss (round 116, where they lost with paper against my rock), they played scissors in round 117, which would beat their last move (paper). This suggests a pattern of playing a move that would beat their last move after a loss.

3. **Comparison with Strategies:**
   - The opponent's behavior after ties and losses aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."
   - However, the opponent's behavior after ties does not fully match this strategy, as they played a move that would lose to their last move after a tie (round 120 to 121).

Given the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to align most closely with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round." However, there are inconsistencies, particularly after ties, suggesting a possible mixed strategy or adaptation.

Considering these observations, the strategy that best fits is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played scissors, they would likely play paper next, as paper loses to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Analyzing the Opponent's Moves:**

   - **Round 121:** My play: Rock, Opponent play: Scissors (I win)
   - **Round 122:** My play: Scissors, Opponent play: Rock (Opponent wins)
   - **Round 123:** My play: ?, Opponent play: ?

   Observing the transition from round 121 to 122:
   - After losing in round 121, the opponent played Rock in round 122, which beats my previous move (Scissors).

2. **Possible Strategies:**

   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
   - **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on both previous outcomes and transitions.

3. **Matching Strategy to Observed Behavior:**

   - The opponent's move in round 122 (Rock) was a response to losing in round 121. They played a move that would beat their last round's move (Scissors).
   - This behavior matches **Strategy 5**, where after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.

4. **Conclusion:**

   Based on the observed behavior, the opponent seems to follow Strategy 5. This strategy predicts their moves accurately, considering their response to a loss in round 121.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they won with 'rock'. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or change based on the outcome.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent's behavior after a win, loss, or tie suggests a complex strategy that considers both the outcome and the previous move.
   - The strategy that describes this behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy seems to align with the observed behavior, as the opponent's moves often change based on the outcome of the previous round, and they sometimes repeat moves after ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's move in round 129 was 'scissors', which beat my 'paper'. In round 128, the opponent played 'rock', which tied with my 'rock'. In round 127, the opponent played 'paper', which lost to my 'scissors'.
   - Let's look at the transitions:
     - Round 127: Opponent played 'paper' (lost to my 'scissors').
     - Round 128: Opponent played 'rock' (tied with my 'rock').
     - Round 129: Opponent played 'scissors' (beat my 'paper').

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After losing in round 127, the opponent played 'rock' in round 128, which tied with my 'rock'.
   - After tying in round 128, the opponent played 'scissors' in round 129, which beat my 'paper'.

3. **Strategy Comparison:**
   - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit because the opponent played 'rock' after 'paper', which doesn't beat 'paper'.
   - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit because the opponent played 'scissors' after 'rock', which doesn't lose to 'rock'.
   - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
     - This fits for round 129, as 'scissors' beats my 'paper'.
   - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit because the opponent didn't play 'rock' in round 129.
   - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move; after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move; after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - This doesn't fit because the opponent didn't play 'rock' after tying with 'rock'.
   - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move; after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move; after a tie, they play the same move.
     - This doesn't fit because the opponent didn't play 'rock' after tying with 'rock'.
   - **Strategy 7:** Complex strategy based on both the previous outcome and transition.
     - This strategy is complex and could potentially fit, but let's check if a simpler strategy fits first.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's behavior in the last few rounds aligns most closely with **Strategy 3**, where the opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move. This is evident in round 129, where the opponent played 'scissors' to beat my 'paper'.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last round's move, and since I played 'paper' last, I predict their next play will be 'scissors' to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with each potential strategy:

1. **The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move:**
   - This would mean if they played 'scissors', they would play 'rock' next, and so on.
   - This strategy doesn't align with the history, as there are instances where the opponent doesn't follow this pattern.

2. **The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move:**
   - This would mean if they played 'scissors', they would play 'paper' next, and so on.
   - This strategy doesn't consistently match the history either.

3. **The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move:**
   - This would mean if I played 'rock', they would play 'paper' next, and so on.
   - This strategy doesn't consistently match the history either.

4. **The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move:**
   - This would mean if I played 'rock', they would play 'rock' next, and so on.
   - This strategy doesn't consistently match the history either.

5. **After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move:**
   - This strategy doesn't consistently match the history either.

6. **After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round:**
   - This strategy doesn't consistently match the history either.

7. **The opponent's transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made:**
   - This strategy is complex and considers both the outcome and the transition made by the opponent. It seems to fit the observed behavior more accurately, as it allows for different responses based on the combination of the previous outcome and transition.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the last strategy seems to best explain the observed moves. It accounts for different responses based on both the outcome and the transition, which aligns with the inconsistent patterns seen in the history.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round where they played 'scissors' against my 'rock'. According to the strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8442446756205111, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9465759237378353, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' next to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves after a tie: 
     - Round 115: Tie (paper vs. paper), next move: paper (same move).
     - Round 120: Tie (rock vs. rock), next move: rock (same move).
     - Round 128: Tie (rock vs. rock), next move: paper (move that would beat their last move).
     - Round 137: Tie (paper vs. paper), next move: unknown.
   - The opponent's moves after a win:
     - Round 116: Win (paper vs. rock), next move: paper (same move).
     - Round 122: Win (rock vs. scissors), next move: rock (same move).
   - The opponent's moves after a loss:
     - Round 129: Loss (scissors vs. paper), next move: rock (move that would beat their last move).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move and sometimes switches to the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat the same move.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches to the move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to partially fit, but the behavior after ties does not consistently match.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" also partially fits, but again, the behavior after ties is inconsistent.
   - The complex strategy that depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to fit the observed behavior more accurately, especially considering the variability after ties and the consistent behavior after wins and losses.

Based on the analysis, the complex strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to best explain the opponent's behavior.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that my opponent will play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by my opponent, my best move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent has played 'rock' in the last two rounds, resulting in ties.
   - Before that, the opponent's plays have been 'scissors', 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors', 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors', 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors', 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors', 'rock', 'paper',

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent has shown a tendency to repeat their previous move when we tie, as seen in rounds 128 and 138. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict the opponent will play rock again.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in responses to my moves:**
   - The opponent's move in round 139 was "scissors" after I played "paper" in round 138, which they won. In round 138, they played "rock" against my "rock," resulting in a tie.
   - In round 137, they played "paper" against my "paper," resulting in a tie. In round 136, they played "scissors" against my "rock," which they lost.

2. **Behavior based on outcomes:**
   - After a win (round 139), the opponent played "scissors," which would beat their previous move "rock" from round 138.
   - After a tie (round 138), they played "scissors," which would beat their previous move "rock" from round 137.
   - After a tie (round 137), they played "rock," which would lose to their previous move "paper" from round 136.
   - After a loss (round 136), they played "paper," which would beat their previous move "scissors" from round 135.

3. **Strategy prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a win.
   - After a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - After a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move.

This behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

However, upon further analysis, the opponent's behavior does not perfectly match any single strategy, but it most closely aligns with the strategy where they adjust based on the outcome of the previous round. The opponent's moves seem to be influenced by both their last move and the outcome of the round.

Therefore, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has played 'scissors' in the last two rounds where I played 'paper', resulting in two consecutive losses for me. This suggests a pattern where the opponent might be playing the move that beats my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - In round 139, the opponent played 'scissors' and won against my 'paper'. In round 140, they played 'scissors' again, which suggests they might repeat their move after a win.
   - In round 137, there was a tie with both playing 'paper', and in round 138, the opponent played 'rock', which would lose to their previous 'paper'. This suggests a potential pattern after ties.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

   - This strategy explains:
     - The repetition of 'scissors' after winning in round 139.
     - The change from 'paper' to 'rock' after a tie in round 137.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's observed behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch strategies after certain outcomes.
   - For example, in round 116, after losing with 'paper' against my 'rock', they switched to 'scissors' in round 117, which would beat 'paper'. This suggests a reaction to the loss.
   - In round 120, after a tie with 'rock', they played 'rock' again in round 121, which could suggest a pattern of repeating moves after ties.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** After winning, the opponent sometimes repeats the winning move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses:** After losing, they often switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** After ties, they sometimes repeat the same move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to fit some of the observed behavior, but not consistently.
   - The strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." is complex but could explain the variability in their moves, as it considers both the outcome and the previous transition.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's behavior, the last strategy seems to best account for the observed patterns, as it allows for different responses based on both the outcome and the previous move transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to beat their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors against my rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors against my rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, their likely next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.39917149738331337, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior:

1. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent's moves after each round need to be analyzed to see if there's a consistent pattern.
   - We need to check if they are reacting to their own last move, my last move, or the outcome of the previous round.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome:**
   - **Wins:** After a win, the opponent's behavior should be consistent with one of the strategies. We need to check if they repeat their move, change to a move that beats their last move, or change to a move that would lose to their last move.
   - **Losses:** After a loss, the opponent might change their strategy. We need to see if they switch to a move that would beat their last move, repeat their move, or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.
   - **Ties:** After a tie, the opponent might either repeat their move, switch to a move that beats their last move, or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's strategy should consistently predict their moves based on the above patterns.

Let's analyze the history:

- **Round 158:** Tie with both playing scissors. We need to see what the opponent plays next to determine their reaction to a tie.
- **Previous Patterns:** 
  - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move or plays a move that beats their last move.
  - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would beat their last move.
  - After a tie, the opponent's next move is crucial to determine if they repeat, switch to a move that beats, or switch to a move that loses.

Given the complexity of the opponent's behavior, the strategy that seems to fit best is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the transition made by the opponent. This strategy accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses based on different scenarios.

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are some repeated patterns. For example, when I played 'scissors' and won, the opponent played 'paper' (round 110), and when I played 'rock' and won, the opponent played 'scissors' (round 111). This suggests that the opponent might be playing the move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 111: opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'paper').
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 115: opponent played 'paper' after tying with 'paper').

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior. This strategy would predict that the opponent plays a move that would lose to their previous move, which aligns with several instances in the history.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would lose to their last round's move, and since they played 'paper' in the last round, I predict their next play will be 'rock' (as 'rock' loses to 'paper').

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in responses to my moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my previous moves, but there isn't a consistent pattern of them playing the move that would beat or lose to my last move. 

2. **Behavior changes based on outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 115 to 116, opponent played paper after winning with paper).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 116 to 117, opponent played paper after losing with paper).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 158 to 159, opponent played paper after tying with scissors).

3. **Strategy prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains the observed moves most accurately, as it accounts for the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and switch to a losing move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Observing the opponent's recent plays, they have shown a tendency to play 'rock' after losing to 'scissors'. Given that I just played 'scissors' and won, it is likely they will play 'rock' to counter my 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by my opponent, my best move would be to play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }

Top hypotheses: {81: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.61062062675091, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 161: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

To determine which strategy the opponent is using, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the potential strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there is a noticeable pattern where they often play the move that beats my last move. For example:
     - Round 162: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors' (beats paper).
     - Round 161: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper' (loses to scissors).
     - Round 160: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock' (loses to paper).
     - Round 159: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper' (same as my move).
     - Round 158: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors' (same as my move).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to play the move that would lose to their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or plays a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the observed moves accurately, as the opponent's transitions seem to depend on the outcome of the previous round.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round to beat their last move, which was scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter this and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, the opponent played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9065100124828935, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played paper and I played scissors), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's play after round 167 was 'scissors', which beat my 'paper' from round 167. This suggests they might be playing the move that beats my last move.
   - In round 166, they played 'paper' against my 'scissors', which I won. In round 167, they played 'scissors', which beats 'paper'. This could suggest a pattern of playing the move that beats their last move after a loss.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a loss in round 162 (opponent played 'scissors', I played 'paper'), they played 'rock' in round 163, which loses to 'scissors'. This suggests they might be playing the move that loses to their last move after a loss.
   - After a win in round 161 (opponent played 'paper', I played 'scissors'), they played 'scissors' again in round 162, which beats 'paper'. This suggests they might be playing the move that beats their last move after a win.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the observed moves accurately, as the opponent tends to play the move that beats their last move after a win and the move that loses to their last move after a loss.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round to beat their last move, which was scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Identify Patterns in Opponent's Moves:**
   - The opponent has played 'scissors' against my 'paper' multiple times, resulting in my loss.
   - The opponent's moves seem to counter my previous moves effectively.

2. **Analyze Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After my losses (e.g., rounds 129, 139, 140, 162, 163, 167, 168), the opponent consistently played 'scissors' when I played 'paper'.
   - After my wins (e.g., rounds 119, 121, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 160, 161, 164, 165, 166), the opponent's move did not consistently follow a pattern of repeating or changing based on their last move.

3. **Compare with Possible Strategies:**
   - The opponent does not seem to play the move that would beat their last round's move or lose to it consistently.
   - The opponent does not consistently play the move that would beat my last round's move or the same move as my last round's move.
   - The opponent's behavior does not change consistently after wins, losses, or ties in a way that matches the simpler strategies.

4. **Complex Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to fit the complex strategy where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made.
   - This strategy accounts for the opponent's ability to counter my moves effectively and adapt based on the outcome and their previous transition.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's behavior is best explained by the complex strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. Therefore, the selected strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round and played scissors, which would beat my play from two rounds ago (paper). According to their strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, I should play rock to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats the same move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - Wins: The opponent sometimes repeats the same move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - Losses: The opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - Ties: The opponent sometimes plays a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior well.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and play a losing move after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', I should play 'paper' in the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7717530539971428, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9731469750497098, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best explains their behavior.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's plays after my moves are as follows:
     - Round 177: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock' (opponent won).
     - Round 176: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock' (I won).
     - Round 175: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors' (I won).
     - Round 174: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper' (I won).
     - Round 173: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock' (I won).
     - Round 172: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors' (I won).
     - Round 171: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper' (I won).
     - Round 170: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock' (I won).
     - Round 169: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors' (I won).
     - Round 168: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors' (opponent won).
     - Round 167: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors' (opponent won).
     - Round 166: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper' (I won).
     - Round 165: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock' (I won).
     - Round 164: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors' (I won).
     - Round 163: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors' (opponent won).
     - Round 162: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors' (opponent won).
     - Round 161: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper' (I won).
     - Round 160: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock' (I won).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their previous move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less clear but seems to involve switching to a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Evaluation:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to switch to a move that would beat their last move after a win and to play a move that would lose to their last move after a loss. It also accounts for the occasional repetition of moves after ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next, as it would beat their last move 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's recent plays have been rock when I played scissors, resulting in my loss. This suggests they might be trying to counter my moves effectively.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - In rounds 177 and 178, the opponent played rock after winning against my scissors. This indicates they might be sticking to a move after winning.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - Let's evaluate the strategies:
     - **Strategy 1:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. This doesn't fit, as they played rock twice.
     - **Strategy 2:** The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. This doesn't fit, as they played rock twice.
     - **Strategy 3:** The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move. This doesn't fit, as they played rock twice.
     - **Strategy 4:** The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move. This doesn't fit, as they played rock twice.
     - **Strategy 5:** After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. This fits, as they played rock after winning with rock.
     - **Strategy 6:** After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. This doesn't fit, as they played rock twice after winning.
     - **Strategy 7:** The opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This is complex and doesn't fit the observed pattern of repeating rock after a win.

Based on the analysis, Strategy 5 best explains the opponent's behavior. They repeated rock after winning, which aligns with the strategy of repeating the same move after a win.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. Since they won the last round with 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }
            ```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has a tendency to play 'rock' after I play 'scissors' and 'paper' after I play 'rock'. This suggests they might be trying to play the move that beats my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats the move that won them the round.
   - After a loss, they tend to switch to a move that would beat my last move.
   - After a tie, they sometimes repeat the move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to match the observed behavior:
     - After wins, they often repeat the winning move.
     - After losses, they switch to a move that would beat my last move.
     - After ties, they sometimes switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's move in round 184 was 'paper', which beat my 'rock'. In round 183, they played 'paper' against my 'scissors', which they lost. In round 182, they played 'rock' against my 'paper', which they lost. In round 181, they played 'scissors' against my 'rock', which they lost.
   - The opponent's move in round 181 was 'scissors', which lost to my 'rock'. In round 180, they played 'paper' against my 'scissors', which they lost. In round 179, they played 'rock' against my 'paper', which they lost.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After losing in round 183, they played 'paper' in round 184, which beat my 'rock'.
   - After losing in round 182, they played 'rock' in round 183, which lost to my 'scissors'.
   - After losing in round 181, they played 'scissors' in round 182, which lost to my 'paper'.
   - After losing in round 180, they played 'paper' in round 181, which lost to my 'rock'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss. This is evident from the transition from round 183 to 184, where they played 'paper' after losing with 'rock'.
   - The opponent's behavior does not seem to change after a win or tie, as they have not won or tied in the recent rounds provided.

Given these observations, the opponent's strategy seems to align with the following description:
- "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains their behavior of playing the move that would beat their last move after a loss.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and won. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' next, as it beats 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter it and win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - In rounds 184 and 185, the opponent played 'paper' against my 'rock', which resulted in a win for them both times. This suggests they might be repeating their winning move after a win.
   - In rounds 177 and 178, the opponent played 'rock' against my 'scissors', which resulted in a win for them both times. Again, they repeated their winning move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move (e.g., rounds 177 to 178, 184 to 185).
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch to a move that beats their last move (e.g., round 176 was a loss for them with 'rock', and they switched to 'rock' again in round 177, which beat my 'scissors').
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less clear, but they seem to switch to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 158 was a tie with 'scissors', and they switched to 'rock' in round 159).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy best explains the opponent's behavior as they repeat their move after a win, switch to a winning move after a loss, and switch to a losing move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as in the last round. Since they won the last round with 'paper', their likely play in the next round will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.84150999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, their next play is likely to be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {179: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.32233989510000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the given history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat their move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their previous move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would lose to their previous move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where their response depends on the outcome of the previous round.
   - Specifically, the strategy where "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to fit well with the observed behavior.

Given these observations, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the patterns in their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - From rounds 141 to 157, the opponent consistently lost, suggesting they were not adapting effectively to my moves.
   - In rounds 158 and 159, there were ties, and in round 160, the opponent lost again.
   - In rounds 162 and 163, the opponent won by playing scissors against my paper.
   - In rounds 167 and 168, the opponent won again by playing scissors against my paper.
   - In rounds 177 and 178, the opponent won by playing rock against my scissors.
   - In rounds 184 and 185, the opponent won by playing paper against my rock.
   - In round 190, the opponent won by playing paper against my rock.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After winning, the opponent tends to repeat the move that led to their victory (e.g., playing scissors after winning with scissors).
   - After losing, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., switching from rock to paper after losing with rock).
   - After ties, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes repeat the move.

3. **Strategy Evaluation:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with a strategy where they repeat a winning move, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and sometimes repeat a move after a tie.
   - This suggests a pattern where the opponent adapts based on the outcome of the previous round.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat a move or switch to a move that would beat or lose to their previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win: The opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 184 to 185, both 'paper'), or switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 186 to 187, 'scissors' to 'rock').
   - After a loss: The opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 177 to 178, 'scissors' to 'scissors' again, which would beat 'rock'), or repeats their move.
   - After a tie: The opponent sometimes switches to a move that would lose to their last move (e.g., round 158 to 159, 'scissors' to 'paper').

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well with the observed behavior:
     - After wins, the opponent sometimes repeats their move.
     - After losses, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would beat their last move.
     - After ties, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided.

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are some patterns that can be observed.
   - When I played 'paper' and lost (rounds 162, 163, 167, 168, 195), the opponent played 'scissors' consistently, which beats 'paper'.
   - When I played 'rock' and lost (rounds 184, 185, 190), the opponent played 'paper', which beats 'rock'.
   - When I played 'scissors' and lost (rounds 177, 178), the opponent played 'rock', which beats 'scissors'.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After winning, the opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last move. For example, after winning with 'scissors' against my 'paper', they continue with 'rock' which beats 'scissors'.
   - After losing, the opponent seems to switch to the move that would beat their last move. For example, after losing with 'rock' against my 'paper', they switch to 'scissors', which beats 'paper'.
   - After ties, the opponent's behavior is less clear, but they seem to sometimes repeat the move or switch to a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy explains the observed moves most accurately, as the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last move after a win, and the move that would lose to their last move after a loss.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after winning the last round with scissors against my paper, they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move, which is rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter is to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has frequently played "scissors" when I played "paper," resulting in my loss. This suggests they might be predicting my moves or following a pattern that counters my previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning (e.g., round 162, 163, 167, 168, 195, 196), the opponent continued playing "scissors" after beating my "paper." This suggests they might be sticking to a winning move.
   - After losing (e.g., round 164, 169, 172, 175, 181, 187, 192), the opponent switched to a move that would beat their previous move, indicating a possible pattern of changing moves after a loss.
   - After ties (e.g., round 158, 159, 189), the opponent's behavior is less clear, but they seem to switch moves.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

This strategy explains the observed behavior: repeating a winning move, changing to a counter-move after a loss, and switching to a losing move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the given history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary, but there are instances where they repeat moves or switch to a counter move. For example, after I played 'rock' and won, they played 'scissors' again, which suggests they might not be directly countering my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to a move that would beat their last move. For example, after they played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock', they played 'scissors' again.
   - After a loss, they often switch to a move that would beat their last move. For example, after losing with 'scissors' to my 'rock', they sometimes play 'rock' next.
   - After a tie, their behavior seems less predictable, but they sometimes repeat the move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not strictly follow a single pattern but seems to have elements of repeating moves after a win and switching to a counter move after a loss.
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Given this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to align most closely with the following description:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it against the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves do not consistently beat or lose to my last move, ruling out the strategies where they play the move that would beat or lose to my last move.
   - The opponent does not consistently play the move that would beat their last move, ruling out that strategy as well.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 150 to 151, 153 to 154) and sometimes changes it (e.g., round 152 to 153, 154 to 155).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes changes their move to beat their last move (e.g., round 177 to 178) and sometimes repeats it (e.g., round 184 to 185).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., round 158 to 159, 198 to 199) and sometimes changes it (e.g., round 189 to 190).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" does not fit well because the opponent does not consistently follow this pattern.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" also does not fit well for similar reasons.
   - The complex strategy involving transitions based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to fit better. The opponent's behavior is not strictly consistent with any simple pattern, suggesting a more complex decision-making process.

Given the analysis, the most fitting strategy is the complex one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses after wins, losses, and ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and the opponent played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their previous move.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to play a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's response varies, sometimes repeating their move or playing a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent often repeats their last move.
   - **Losses:** The opponent often plays a move that would beat their previous move.
   - **Ties:** The opponent's behavior is less consistent, but they sometimes play a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategy:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, change to a winning move after a loss, and sometimes play a losing move after a tie.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best matches the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous move 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to vary based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move or chooses a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but sometimes they repeat their move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses:** The opponent sometimes plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** The opponent's behavior is inconsistent, but they sometimes repeat their move.

3. **Strategy Matching:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to partially fit, but not entirely.
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" also partially fits.
   - The complex strategy involving transitions based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to fit the observed behavior more closely, as it accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the most fitting strategy appears to be the complex one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:

The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Opponent's Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but there are instances where they switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - **Wins:** The opponent tends to repeat their move.
   - **Losses:** The opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties:** The opponent sometimes switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to match the observed behavior:
     - After wins, the opponent repeats their move.
     - After losses, the opponent switches to a move that would beat their last move.
     - After ties, the opponent sometimes switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent frequently plays 'rock' after I play 'paper', which results in my win.
   - The opponent often plays 'scissors' after I play 'rock', which results in my win.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays 'scissors' after I play 'scissors', resulting in a tie.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a loss (when I win), the opponent sometimes repeats the move that lost, but often switches to a move that would beat my last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they adjust their move based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - The opponent often plays the move that would beat my last move after they lose, which suggests they are trying to counter my previous winning move.
   - After a tie, they sometimes repeat the same move, which aligns with a strategy that changes based on the outcome.

Given these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is:

- **After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.**
- **After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat my last round's move.**
- **After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move.**

This aligns with the strategy described as: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Therefore, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7599, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since they won the last round with 'paper', it is likely they will play 'paper' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors in the next round to beat their previous move of paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played rock and I played paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their move.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'paper' next to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9996090178951418, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played rock and I played paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9998658931380336, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {200: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.3999342876376366, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies provided.

1. **Analyzing the Opponent's Moves:**
   - In round 226, the opponent played 'scissors' after I played 'paper' in round 225. This resulted in a loss for me.
   - In round 225, the opponent played 'paper' after I played 'scissors' in round 224. This resulted in a win for me.
   - In round 224, the opponent played 'rock' after I played 'paper' in round 223. This resulted in a win for me.

2. **Checking for Patterns:**
   - The opponent's move in round 226 ('scissors') would beat their previous move in round 225 ('paper').
   - The opponent's move in round 225 ('paper') would beat their previous move in round 224 ('rock').
   - The opponent's move in round 224 ('rock') would beat their previous move in round 223 ('scissors').

3. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win (round 224), the opponent played the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a win (round 225), the opponent again played the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss (round 226), the opponent played the move that would beat their last move.

4. **Matching with Strategies:**
   - The strategy "The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move" fits the observed pattern. The opponent consistently plays the move that would beat their own last move, regardless of the outcome (win, loss, or tie).

Based on this analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy where they play the move that would beat their last round's move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'scissors', their likely next play is 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Identifying Patterns:**
   - The opponent has played 'scissors' in the last two rounds, both resulting in wins for them against my 'paper'.
   - Before these two rounds, the opponent played 'rock' against my 'scissors', which resulted in a loss for them.
   - The opponent's move sequence in the last few rounds: 'rock', 'scissors', 'scissors'.

2. **Response to Wins, Losses, and Ties:**
   - After a loss (round 225), the opponent switched from 'rock' to 'scissors', which beats my 'paper' in round 226.
   - After winning in round 226, the opponent repeated 'scissors' in round 227, which again beat my 'paper'.
   - This suggests that after a win, the opponent might repeat their move.

3. **Strategy Evaluation:**
   - The opponent's behavior after a win (repeating the same move) aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."
   - After a loss, the opponent switched to a move that would beat my last move, which aligns with: "After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's behavior is best explained by the strategy:
"After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Here's the strategy in the required format:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and won. Therefore, their likely play in the next round is 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.2537243816848846, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 228: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine which strategy best explains the opponent's behavior, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Responses:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to follow a pattern where they often play the move that would beat their previous move after a loss. For example:
     - Round 184: Opponent played 'paper' and lost to 'rock', then played 'paper' again in round 185.
     - Round 195: Opponent played 'scissors' and won against 'paper', then played 'scissors' again in round 196.
     - Round 226: Opponent played 'scissors' and won against 'paper', then played 'scissors' again in round 227.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat the same move.
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent tends to play the move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits this pattern is: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

This strategy accurately predicts the observed moves, especially the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win and change moves after a loss or tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played scissors, so the move that would lose to scissors is paper. Therefore, I predict that the opponent's next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, I should play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - The opponent tends to repeat the same move after a win.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch to the move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to the move that would beat their last move.

3. **Strategy Evaluation:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit the observed behavior well.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my previous moves. For instance, when I played 'rock' and won against their 'scissors', they sometimes switched to 'paper' in the next round, which would beat 'rock'.
   - However, there are instances where they repeated the same move or switched to a move that would lose to my previous move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win: The opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss: The opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie: The opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and their previous transition. This is evident from the mixed responses after wins, losses, and ties, which are not consistent with simpler strategies like always playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the complex one where their transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition they made. This strategy accounts for the variability in their responses after different outcomes.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', I should play 'paper' to counter it and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their move and secure a win.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9789195608893808, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter their move and win the round.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. According to their strategy, they will play 'scissors' next to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best move to counter this would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9997082195879468, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played paper and I played scissors), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

Top hypotheses: {191: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.39979575371156273, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's last move was "scissors" when I played "paper" in round 253, resulting in their win.
   - In round 252, the opponent played "paper" when I played "scissors", resulting in their loss.
   - In round 251, the opponent played "rock" when I played "paper", resulting in their loss.
   - In round 250, the opponent played "scissors" when I played "rock", resulting in their loss.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (round 253), the opponent played "scissors" which beats "paper".
   - After a loss (round 252), the opponent played "scissors" which beats "paper".
   - After a loss (round 251), the opponent played "rock" which loses to "paper".
   - After a loss (round 250), the opponent played "scissors" which loses to "rock".

3. **Strategy Analysis:**
   - The opponent seems to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a win (round 253).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last round's move (round 252) and sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last round's move (round 251).
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently match any single strategy perfectly, but it aligns most closely with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's behavior is best explained by the following strategy:

```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {191: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.5798570275980939, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior.

1. **Identifying Patterns:**
   - From rounds 205 to 225, the opponent consistently lost, indicating they might not have been adapting effectively during this period.
   - Starting from round 226, the opponent began winning more frequently, suggesting a possible change in strategy or adaptation.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** After the opponent wins (e.g., rounds 226, 227), they continue to play the move that would beat their last move. For example, after winning with 'scissors' against 'paper', they continue with 'scissors'.
   - **Losses:** After losses (e.g., rounds 228, 229), they switch to a move that beats their last move. For example, after losing with 'rock' against 'paper', they switch to 'scissors'.
   - **Ties:** After ties (e.g., round 230), they seem to repeat the same move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where:
     - After a win, they play the move that would beat their last move.
     - After a loss, they play the move that would beat their last move.
     - After a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last move.

This behavior aligns with the following strategy description:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they won with scissors. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next, as it beats scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7058999193186657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their move.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last move after a loss. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round to beat their previous move of scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter their move and win the round.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9971504934222166, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, their next play is likely to be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent often plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays a move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - **Wins**: The opponent tends to either repeat their move or play a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Losses**: The opponent tends to play a move that would beat their last move.
   - **Ties**: The opponent sometimes repeats their move or plays a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to match the observed behavior.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win, change to a winning move after a loss, and sometimes lose intentionally after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the following strategy:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they won with 'rock'. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

Top hypotheses: {255: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': 0.46769041003496603, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent's moves after each round need to be analyzed to see if they follow a consistent pattern based on the outcome of the previous round (win, lose, or tie).

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - **Wins:** After a win, the opponent's behavior needs to be checked to see if they repeat their move, change to a move that would beat their last move, or change to a move that would lose to their last move.
   - **Losses:** After a loss, the opponent's behavior needs to be checked to see if they repeat their move, change to a move that would beat their last move, or change to a move that would lose to their last move.
   - **Ties:** After a tie, the opponent's behavior needs to be checked to see if they repeat their move, change to a move that would beat their last move, or change to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that most accurately predicts the opponent's moves based on the above analysis should be selected.

**Analysis of Recent Rounds:**

- **Round 270:** My play: Scissors, Opponent play: Rock (I lost)
  - Opponent played Rock, which beats Scissors.
  
- **Round 271:** My play: Paper, Opponent play: Paper (Tie)
  - Opponent repeated their move from the previous round.

**Possible Strategies:**

- The opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
- The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
- The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponent's last round's move.
- The opponent plays the same move as their opponent's last round's move.
- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
- After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the analysis, the opponent seems to follow the strategy where after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. This is consistent with the observed behavior in round 271. Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie and they played paper, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of paper, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - After my wins, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After my losses, the opponent tends to play the move that would beat their last move.
   - After ties, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but they sometimes play the move that would lose to their last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a loss (for me), the opponent plays a move that would beat their last move, suggesting they are trying to counter my winning move.
   - After a win (for me), the opponent seems to play a move that would beat their last move, indicating they are trying to counter my previous strategy.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move, which could be a strategy to counter a potential repeat move from me.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits this behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to counter my winning moves and their occasional repetition after ties.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played rock and I played scissors), they will play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, I should play rock to counter this and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided interaction history and the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to play 'rock' frequently, especially in the recent rounds.
   - In rounds 270 and 272, the opponent played 'rock' after I played 'scissors', which resulted in their win.
   - In round 273, both the opponent and I played 'rock', resulting in a tie.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning in round 270 with 'rock' against my 'scissors', the opponent played 'paper' in round 271, which resulted in a tie.
   - After tying in round 271 with 'paper', the opponent played 'rock' in round 272, which resulted in their win against my 'scissors'.
   - After winning in round 272 with 'rock', the opponent played 'rock' again in round 273, resulting in a tie.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to play 'rock' frequently, especially after a win or tie.
   - After a win, the opponent repeated the move ('rock' in rounds 272 and 273).
   - After a tie, the opponent switched from 'paper' to 'rock' (rounds 271 to 272).

Considering these observations, the opponent's behavior aligns most closely with the strategy where:
- After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This aligns with the description: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Therefore, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played 'rock', resulting in a tie. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter this and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - From rounds 225 to 274, the opponent's moves are as follows:
     - They often play 'scissors' after I play 'paper' and win.
     - They often play 'rock' after I play 'scissors' and win.
     - They often play 'paper' after I play 'rock' and win.
   - However, there are instances where they deviate from this pattern, especially after ties or losses.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcome:**
   - **After Wins:** The opponent seems to repeat the move that won them the round.
   - **After Losses:** The opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - **After Ties:** The opponent sometimes repeats their last move or switches to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move."

This strategy explains the observed moves most accurately, as it accounts for the opponent's tendency to repeat winning moves, switch after losses, and change unpredictably after ties.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper to beat their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has played 'scissors' against my 'paper' multiple times, resulting in a win for them.
   - After winning with 'scissors', they continued to play 'scissors' in the next round (e.g., rounds 253-255).
   - When I played 'rock' and won, the opponent played 'rock' in the next round (e.g., rounds 270-271).

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats the move that won (e.g., after winning with 'scissors', they played 'scissors' again).
   - After a loss, the opponent tends to switch to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., after losing with 'rock' against my 'scissors', they played 'scissors' again).
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., after a tie with 'rock', they played 'rock' again).

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the strategy: "After a win, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

This strategy explains the observed behavior, as the opponent repeats winning moves, changes losing moves to beat their previous move, and sometimes repeats the same move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent won by playing scissors against my paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my last move rather than their own. For instance, when I played 'rock' and won, they played 'scissors' the next round, which is beaten by 'rock'.
   - When I lost with 'paper' against their 'scissors', they continued with 'scissors', which suggests they might repeat their winning move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the winning move (e.g., round 275 to 276, they played 'scissors' after winning with 'scissors').
   - After a loss, they seem to switch to a move that would beat their last move (e.g., round 270 to 271, they played 'paper' after losing with 'rock').
   - After a tie, they sometimes repeat the move (e.g., round 273 to 274, they played 'rock' after a tie with 'rock').

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well.
   - This strategy explains the opponent's tendency to repeat winning moves, switch to a counter move after a loss, and sometimes repeat the move after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy aligns best with their behavior.

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - From rounds 228 to 252, the opponent consistently played a move that lost to my move, resulting in my continuous wins. This suggests a pattern where they might be playing the move that loses to my last move.
   - From rounds 253 to 255, I played 'paper' and the opponent played 'scissors', which beats 'paper', resulting in my losses. This indicates a possible change in strategy.
   - From rounds 256 to 277, the opponent reverted to a pattern where their move loses to my move, resulting in my wins again.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After my losses in rounds 253 to 255, the opponent continued playing 'scissors', suggesting they might stick to a move after winning.
   - After ties, such as in round 271, the opponent played 'rock' again in round 272, which could indicate they play the same move after a tie.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they play the move that would lose to my last move, except when they win or tie, where they might repeat their move.

Considering these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is: "The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move, and their last move was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely play in the next round is 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7101181224919912, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as the last round. In the last round, they won with 'paper'. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best explains their behavior:

1. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - From rounds 231 to 252, the opponent consistently lost, indicating they might have been using a predictable strategy.
   - From rounds 253 to 255, the opponent won by playing scissors against my paper, suggesting a change in strategy.
   - From rounds 256 to 270, the opponent lost again, indicating they might have reverted to a previous strategy or tried a new one.
   - From rounds 271 to 280, the opponent's moves resulted in a mix of ties, wins, and losses.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 253), the opponent continued playing scissors, which suggests they might repeat their winning move.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 256), the opponent switched to a move that would beat their last move, indicating a possible change in strategy.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 280), the opponent played the same move again, suggesting they might repeat their move after a tie.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with a strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that beats their last move after a loss, and repeat their move after a tie. This aligns with the strategy: "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy appears to be:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the history of interactions and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 232 to 252, the opponent consistently lost to my moves, suggesting they might be playing a predictable pattern.
   - From rounds 253 to 255, the opponent played 'scissors' three times in a row, winning against my 'paper'.
   - In rounds 256 to 270, the opponent lost consistently again, except for round 270 where they won with 'rock' against my 'scissors'.
   - In rounds 271 to 273, the opponent played 'paper', 'rock', and 'rock', resulting in a tie, a loss, and a tie.
   - In rounds 274 to 281, the opponent lost most rounds, except for round 278 where they won with 'paper' against my 'rock'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the winning move (e.g., 'scissors' in rounds 253-255).
   - After a loss, the opponent often changes their move, but not consistently to a specific pattern.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the move or switches to a different one.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not strictly follow a simple pattern like playing the move that would beat or lose to their last move.
   - The opponent's moves after wins, losses, and ties do not consistently align with a single strategy.
   - The most complex strategy, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition, seems to fit the observed behavior best. This strategy accounts for the variability in the opponent's responses after different outcomes.

Given the analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the most complex one, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'rock' and my opponent played 'scissors', resulting in my win. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (since two rounds ago I played 'rock' and they played 'paper'), they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move is 'paper' to secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior.

1. **Identifying Patterns:**
   - From rounds 233 to 252, the opponent consistently played a move that lost to my move, resulting in my continuous wins. This suggests they might be playing the move that would lose to their last round's move or some other pattern.
   - In rounds 253 to 255, I lost three times in a row when I played paper against their scissors. This indicates they might have switched strategies.
   - From rounds 256 to 269, I won consistently again, suggesting they reverted to a predictable pattern.
   - In rounds 270 to 273, there were losses and ties, indicating a possible change in their strategy.
   - From rounds 274 to 282, I won most rounds, except for a few losses and ties, suggesting they might have a mixed or adaptive strategy.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, they sometimes repeat the same move or switch to a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be a mix of repeating moves and switching based on the outcome. The strategy that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to fit well, as it accounts for their adaptive behavior after wins, losses, and ties.

Based on this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for their adaptive behavior and changes in response to different outcomes.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and the opponent played rock, resulting in my win. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (rock loses to paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round, I should play scissors to counter their move and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.745479552847229, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played paper and I played scissors), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to play moves that beat my previous move, especially after I win. For example, after I played 'rock' and won against 'scissors', the opponent played 'rock' (round 270) and 'scissors' (round 272) after I played 'scissors' and 'rock' respectively.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays the same move as my last move, such as in round 271 where both played 'paper'.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move. For example, after winning with 'scissors' against 'paper' in round 283, they played 'scissors' again in round 284.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays the move that would beat their last move, as seen in round 276 where they played 'scissors' after losing with 'rock'.
   - After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but there are instances where they play the move that would lose to their last move, such as in round 271 where both played 'paper'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is: "After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round."

This strategy aligns with the observed patterns where the opponent often plays the move that would beat their last move after a win, and sometimes plays the move that would lose to their last move after a loss. The behavior after ties is less consistent but fits the strategy description.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost, so they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, I should play scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to be reactive to my previous moves, but not in a straightforward manner. They don't consistently play the move that would beat or lose to my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, but not always.
   - After a loss, they sometimes switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, their behavior varies, sometimes repeating their move or switching to a different move.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior doesn't fit neatly into a single simple strategy. However, the complex strategy involving transitions based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to capture the variability in their responses.

Given these observations, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the complex one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the variability and conditional responses observed in the interaction history.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it to the possible strategies:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played 'scissors' against my 'paper' in the last round, resulting in a win for them.
   - Before that, they played 'scissors' against my 'scissors', resulting in a tie.
   - They played 'scissors' against my 'paper' in round 284, resulting in a win for them.
   - They played 'rock' against my 'scissors' in round 270, resulting in a win for them.
   - They played 'rock' against my 'scissors' in round 272, resulting in a win for them.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After winning with 'scissors' in round 284, they played 'scissors' again in round 285.
   - After tying with 'scissors' in round 285, they played 'scissors' again in round 286.
   - After winning with 'scissors' in round 286, they might continue with 'scissors' or change based on a strategy.

3. **Strategy Matching**:
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move" seems to fit well.
   - This strategy explains the repeated use of 'scissors' after winning with it and tying with it.

Given the patterns observed, the opponent seems to follow a strategy where they repeat their move after a win, which aligns with the strategy mentioned above.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they won with scissors. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 238 to 252, the opponent consistently played a move that lost to my move, resulting in my continuous wins.
   - In rounds 253 to 255, the opponent played 'scissors' three times, which beat my 'paper', resulting in my losses.
   - From rounds 256 to 267, the opponent reverted to playing moves that lost to my moves, resulting in my wins.
   - In round 270, the opponent played 'rock' against my 'scissors', resulting in my loss.
   - In round 271, both played 'paper', resulting in a tie.
   - In round 272, the opponent played 'rock' against my 'scissors', resulting in my loss.
   - In round 273, both played 'rock', resulting in a tie.
   - From rounds 274 to 287, the opponent's moves were inconsistent, sometimes resulting in my wins, losses, or ties.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After winning (e.g., rounds 253-255), the opponent tends to repeat the move that won.
   - After losing (e.g., rounds 256-267), the opponent tends to switch to a move that loses to my move.
   - After ties (e.g., rounds 271 and 273), the opponent's next move doesn't show a consistent pattern.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior after wins, losses, and ties suggests a strategy that changes based on the outcome.
   - The opponent seems to repeat winning moves, switch to losing moves after losses, and show inconsistent behavior after ties.

Given these observations, the opponent's strategy aligns most closely with the following description:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost. Therefore, their next play is likely to be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies.

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For example, after a tie in round 288 with both playing 'paper', the opponent might play a move that would lose to 'paper' in the next round.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move or plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes plays a move that would lose to their last move.

3. **Matching Strategies:**
   - The strategy "After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round" seems to fit some of the observed behavior.
   - However, the strategy "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made..." seems to be more complex and might explain the variations better, especially considering the transitions after ties and losses.

Given the complexity and variability in the opponent's responses, the most fitting strategy appears to be the last one, which considers both the previous outcome and the transition made.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and the opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'scissors', my best move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies provided.

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - From rounds 240 to 252, the opponent consistently played a move that would lose to my move, resulting in my continuous wins. This suggests they might have been playing the move that would lose to their last round's move.
   - From rounds 253 to 255, the opponent played scissors against my paper, resulting in my losses. This indicates a change in their strategy.
   - From rounds 256 to 269, the opponent again played moves that would lose to my moves, resulting in my wins.
   - From rounds 270 to 272, the opponent played rock against my scissors and paper, resulting in my losses and ties. This suggests they might have been playing the move that would beat their last round's move.
   - From rounds 273 to 289, the opponent's moves resulted in a mix of ties and losses for me, indicating a possible shift in strategy.

2. **Behavior Based on Outcomes**:
   - After a win (for me), the opponent sometimes changed their move, but not consistently.
   - After a loss (for me), the opponent sometimes repeated their move or changed it.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeated their move or changed it.

3. **Strategy Prediction**:
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently match any single strategy. However, the strategy that involves changing moves based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to fit their behavior in some rounds.
   - Specifically, the strategy that considers the opponent's transition based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems to explain the variability in their responses.

Given the analysis, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is the one where the opponent's transition depends on both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy accounts for the variability and changes in their moves across different rounds.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both my opponent and I played rock, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see which strategy best fits their behavior:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - From rounds 241 to 252, the opponent consistently lost, indicating they might not have been adapting effectively to my moves.
   - In rounds 253 to 255, the opponent won by playing scissors against my paper, suggesting a possible change in strategy.
   - In rounds 256 to 269, the opponent lost consistently again, indicating they might have reverted to a less effective strategy.
   - In rounds 270 to 272, the opponent won or tied, suggesting another possible strategy shift.
   - In rounds 273 to 290, the opponent's performance was mixed, with ties and losses.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win (e.g., round 253), the opponent continued with the same move (scissors) in the following rounds (254, 255), which resulted in wins.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 256), the opponent did not immediately change their move, suggesting they might not be adapting based on losses.
   - After ties (e.g., rounds 271, 273, 280, 285, 290), the opponent's subsequent moves varied, indicating inconsistency in response to ties.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior does not consistently align with a simple strategy like playing the move that beats or loses to their last move.
   - The opponent's behavior after wins, losses, and ties does not consistently follow a pattern of repeating, beating, or losing to their last move.
   - The complex strategy involving transitions based on both the previous outcome and the previous transition seems too intricate given the observed behavior.

Given the analysis, the opponent's behavior seems to align most closely with the strategy where:
- After a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round.
- After a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move.
- After a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move.

This strategy explains their behavior in rounds 253-255 (wins followed by the same move) and some ties followed by losses.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():

                'Opponent_strategy': ''

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history provided:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change based on the outcome of the previous round. For example, after I played 'scissors' and won against their 'paper' in round 291, we need to see how they respond in the next round.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win: In round 291, I won with 'scissors' against their 'paper'. We need to check if they play a move that would beat, lose to, or repeat their last move.
   - After a loss: In round 290, we both played 'scissors', resulting in a tie. In round 291, they played 'paper', which would lose to their previous move 'scissors'.
   - After a tie: In round 289, we both played 'rock', resulting in a tie. In round 290, they played 'scissors', which would lose to their previous move 'rock'.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent seems to change their move based on the outcome of the previous round. After a tie, they played a move that would lose to their last move. After a win, they played a move that would lose to their last move. This suggests a pattern where they might be playing the move that would lose to their last move after both wins and ties.

Considering these observations, the strategy that best fits the opponent's behavior is: "After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move."

Let's output this strategy in the required format:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best move is to play 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9432534511043688, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Above is the history of interactions. Below are the possible strategies your opponent could be using:
            The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
The opponent plays the move that would beat their opponents last rounds move
The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move
After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round
{"The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made.             After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.            After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.            After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.             After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.             After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.            After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.             After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."}

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
            }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and compare it with the possible strategies:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves don't consistently follow a pattern of beating or losing to their previous move or my previous move. This rules out the first four strategies.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move and sometimes changes it, which doesn't consistently match any single strategy.
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes changes their move to one that would beat their last move, which aligns with some strategies.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes changes their move to one that would lose to their last move, which aligns with some strategies.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The strategy that seems to fit the opponent's behavior is the one where:
     - After a win, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move.
     - After a loss, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last round's move.
     - After a tie, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

This strategy seems to predict the opponent's moves more accurately than others based on the observed behavior.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both of us playing scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

The opponent plays the same move as their opponents last rounds move

            Think step by step about which strategy best explains your opponent's behavior so far.
            Consider:
            1. Are there patterns in how they respond to your moves?
            2. Does their behavior change based on wins, losses, or ties?
            3. Which strategy would predict their observed moves most accurately?

            After your reasoning, select one strategy and output its description in the following Python dictionary format, parsable by ast.literal_eval():
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the provided history:

1. **Patterns in Response to My Moves:**
   - The opponent's moves seem to change in response to my moves, but not in a straightforward manner. They don't consistently play the move that would beat or lose to my last move.

2. **Behavior Based on Wins, Losses, or Ties:**
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move and sometimes changes it.
   - After a loss, they often change their move, but not always in a predictable pattern.
   - After a tie, their response varies, sometimes repeating the move and sometimes changing it.

3. **Strategy Prediction:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be influenced by both the outcome of the previous round and possibly the transition they made in the previous round.
   - The most complex strategy, which considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition, seems to fit the observed behavior. This strategy allows for different responses based on whether the opponent won, lost, or tied, and also considers how they transitioned from the round before last to the last round.

Given this analysis, the strategy that best explains the opponent's behavior is the one that considers both the previous outcome and the previous transition. This strategy is described in the last option provided.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': "The opponents transition from one round to the next depends on both the previous outcome (win, lose, or tie) and the previous transition the opponent made. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move."
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'rock' and my opponent played 'paper', resulting in my loss. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my last move, they will play the move that would beat their last move. Since they played 'paper', the move that beats 'paper' is 'scissors'. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'scissors', my best counter-move is 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
