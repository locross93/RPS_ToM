Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent played rock, and I also played rock, resulting in a tie. Since the reward was 0, it indicates that playing the same choice as my opponent results in a tie. This suggests that my opponent might be playing a static strategy, always choosing the same option regardless of my play.

Based on this observation, I hypothesize that my opponent is playing a static strategy, always choosing rock. This would mean that I can exploit this by playing paper to win against their rock choice.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is always playing rock, I believe their next play will be rock.

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent played rock in the first round and then rock again in the second round. In both cases, I played paper and received a positive reward. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing rock. 

Given this observation, I hypothesize that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always choosing rock. This is supported by the fact that I have received positive rewards every time I played paper, indicating that my opponent's strategy is not adapting to my choices.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent has consistently played rock in the past, it is likely that they will continue with rock in the next round.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent has played rock, rock, and paper in the first three rounds, resulting in a tie, a win for me, and another tie. This suggests that my opponent is not consistently playing the same choice. There is no clear pattern of positive or negative rewards for my opponent's plays, indicating that they may not be following a static strategy.

Given the lack of a clear pattern in my opponent's plays and rewards, it's difficult to make a specific hypothesis about their strategy at this point. It seems that my opponent's choices are not easily predictable based on the limited interaction history.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'It is difficult to determine a specific strategy for my opponent at this time.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent's strategy is difficult to determine, and considering the previous plays of both players, it is likely that the opponent will choose rock in the next round as it has not been played yet.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the predicted opponent's next play, my next play should be paper to counter their potential rock play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

My opponent has played rock twice and paper once. In all three instances, I have played paper and received positive rewards. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing rock. Given this pattern, I can exploit this by consistently playing scissors to counter their rock choice and consistently earn positive rewards.

```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent has played rock twice in a row, it seems likely that they may continue with rock in the next round, assuming they are following a fixed strategy.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the predicted opponent's next play, my next play should be paper to beat their rock.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'It is difficult to determine a specific strategy for my opponent at this time.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 1: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.4659, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 4: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing rock. In the first four rounds, my opponent played rock three times, resulting in positive rewards for me. In the most recent round, my opponent played rock again, leading to another positive reward for me. 

Given this consistent pattern, I hypothesize that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always choosing rock. This provides me with an opportunity to exploit their strategy by consistently playing paper, the counter to rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing rock, their likely play in the next round will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper.
```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not consistently playing the same choice. The previous hypotheses do not provide a clear explanation for the opponent's strategy. However, the fact that I received a reward of 0 when playing paper against their paper suggests that they might be playing a static strategy.

Hypothesis:
My opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always playing paper.

This strategy would explain the consistent tie outcomes when I play paper, and it aligns with the recent interaction where both of us played paper and received a reward of 0.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent's strategy is to always play paper, their likely play in the next round will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing paper. This is supported by the fact that in the last 7 rounds, my opponent has played paper 5 times. Additionally, I have received positive rewards every time I played scissors, indicating that my opponent's strategy is static and I can exploit this by consistently playing rock.

```python

'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing paper and the fact that they played paper in the last round, I predict that their next play will also be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper again, my next play should be scissors to beat their paper.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent's plays are not following a clear pattern. They have played rock, paper, and scissors in a seemingly random manner. There is no consistent positive or negative reward associated with a specific play, indicating that the opponent may not be following a static strategy.

Given the lack of a clear pattern and the absence of consistent positive or negative rewards for specific plays, it is difficult to discern a specific strategy that the opponent is employing. It is possible that the opponent is playing randomly or using a strategy that is not easily discernible from the limited interaction history.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'It is difficult to discern a specific strategy from the opponent's plays so far.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent has played scissors in the last round and the interaction history, it seems that they may not have a fixed policy. However, based on the recent pattern, they might play rock in the next round as a counter to your scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Considering the predicted opponent's next play, your next play should be paper to counter their potential rock play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response:

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing a strategy that counters my previous plays. Specifically, in the last interaction, I played "paper" and my opponent played "scissors," resulting in a negative reward for me. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy to counter my previous plays.

Given this, I will hypothesize that my opponent is playing a static strategy where they consistently play the option that beats my previous play. This means that if I play "rock," they will play "paper," if I play "paper," they will play "scissors," and if I play "scissors," they will play "rock."

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is consistently playing the option that beats my previous play.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's consistent strategy of playing the option that beats your previous play, their likely play in the next round would be scissors, as it beats your previous play of paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of scissors in the next round, your next play should be rock, as it beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

My opponent's likely policy seems to be consistently playing the option that beats my previous play.

Response:

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing rock. This is evident from the fact that in the last two rounds, my opponent played rock and won both times. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing rock.

Therefore, my hypothesis about my opponent's likely policy is:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent has consistently played rock in the past and just won with rock, they may continue to stick to their strategy and play rock again in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent's strategy is not yet clear. However, there are some observations that can be made:

1. In round 11, the opponent played "scissors" and won against my "paper", resulting in a negative reward for me.
2. In round 10, the opponent played "rock" and won against my "scissors", resulting in a negative reward for me.
3. In round 9, the opponent played "scissors" and lost against my "rock", resulting in a positive reward for me.

Based on these observations, it seems that the opponent's strategy is not static and may not be following a simple pattern. The opponent's plays do not consistently result in positive or negative rewards for me, indicating that they may not be playing a static strategy that I can easily exploit.

Given the lack of clear patterns in the opponent's plays and their varying outcomes, it is difficult to determine a specific strategy for my opponent at this time.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'It is difficult to determine a specific strategy for my opponent at this time.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's recent plays of rock, rock, paper, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, and rock, it is difficult to determine a specific pattern or strategy. However, based on the recent history, the opponent may continue to play scissors in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Considering the potential continuation of the opponent's play with scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their potential move.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not playing a static strategy. They have played rock, paper, and scissors in different rounds, and the rewards I received were both positive and negative for the same choices. This indicates that my opponent is not following a simple pattern or static strategy. 

Given the varied plays and rewards, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific strategy at this point. It's possible that my opponent is playing randomly or using a more complex strategy that doesn't follow a simple pattern.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'It's difficult to determine a specific strategy at this point. The opponent's plays and rewards are not following a simple pattern.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's previous plays and the fact that they won the last round, it's likely that they will stick to their winning strategy and play paper again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering the opponent's likely play, you should play scissors in the next round to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent has consistently played rock in the last three rounds, resulting in positive rewards for them. This suggests that they may be playing a static strategy of always choosing rock. As a result, I can exploit this by consistently playing paper to counter their rock choice and consistently gain positive rewards.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing rock, it is likely that they will continue to play rock in the next round, regardless of your previous play.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock, your next play should be paper to counter their rock play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not playing a static strategy. The plays of my opponent have been varied, and there is no consistent pattern that would suggest a simple static strategy. Additionally, I have not observed a consistent positive or negative reward when playing the same choice, which further indicates that my opponent's strategy is not static.

Given the varied plays and rewards, it is likely that my opponent is employing a mixed strategy, where they are randomly choosing between rock, paper, and scissors. This mixed strategy makes it difficult to predict their next move with certainty.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is employing a mixed strategy, randomly choosing between rock, paper, and scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's mixed strategy, it is difficult to predict their next play with certainty. However, considering their previous plays and the fact that they won the last round with scissors, they might stick with scissors or switch to rock to exploit the pattern of my recent plays.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the potential plays of scissors or rock by the opponent, I should play rock in the next round to beat their potential scissors play or tie with their potential rock play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not playing a static strategy. They have won against my rock, lost against my paper, and won against my scissors. This indicates that they might be playing a strategy that counters my previous move. 

Looking at the history, it seems like my opponent is playing a strategy that beats my previous move. For example, when I played rock, they played paper, and when I played paper, they played scissors. This suggests that they might be playing a strategy that tries to counter my previous move.

Based on this observation, my hypothesis is that my opponent is playing a strategy that tries to counter my previous move. They might be using a simple rule-based strategy to counter my previous move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent is likely playing a strategy that counters my previous move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's likely strategy of countering your previous move, it is likely that they will play scissors in the next round to counter your rock play.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, you should play rock in the next round as it will beat their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {15: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is employing a mixed strategy, randomly choosing between rock, paper, and scissors.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

My opponent has played rock in the last two rounds, resulting in a tie both times. This suggests that they may be employing a static strategy of always playing rock. This is further supported by the fact that I have received positive rewards when playing paper, which counters rock. Therefore, I hypothesize that my opponent is playing a static strategy of always choosing rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing rock, their likely play in the next round will also be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, your next play should be paper to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is playing a static strategy. They have played "rock" 6 times, "paper" 7 times, and "scissors" 5 times. There is no clear pattern of positive or negative rewards associated with their plays, indicating that they may not be adapting to my strategy.

Given this, my hypothesis is that my opponent is playing a simple static strategy, possibly choosing their plays randomly or based on a fixed pattern. This suggests that they may not be adapting to my plays and are not employing a complex strategy to counter me.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a simple static strategy, possibly choosing their plays randomly or based on a fixed pattern.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent's strategy seems to be static or based on a fixed pattern, and considering that they have played paper in the last round, it is likely that they will continue with the same play in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering that the opponent is likely to continue with paper, my next play should be scissors to beat their paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {19: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a simple static strategy, possibly choosing their plays randomly or based on a fixed pattern.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 17: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 18: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not adapting their strategy and may be playing a static policy. They have played 'rock' and 'paper' multiple times, and I have consistently received positive rewards when playing 'scissors' against their 'paper'. This suggests that my opponent may have a static strategy of always playing 'paper'.

Therefore, my hypothesis is that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always choosing 'paper'.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing paper, their likely play in the next round would be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, your next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent has played "scissors" in the last two rounds and I have received a reward of 0 both times. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing "scissors". If this pattern continues, I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy, which is "rock". 

Based on the observed data, my hypothesis is that my opponent is always playing "scissors".

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the history of the opponent's plays and the fact that they have played scissors twice in a row, it seems likely that they may continue with scissors in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': If the opponent continues with scissors, you should play rock to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing "scissors" and I have been consistently getting positive rewards when playing "rock" against their "scissors." This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy, always choosing "scissors." 

Given this observation, I hypothesize that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy, always choosing "scissors" as their play. This is supported by the consistent positive rewards I receive when playing "rock" against their "scissors."

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing scissors.'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing scissors and the fact that you played rock in the last round, the opponent's likely play in the next round is scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, your next play should be rock to beat their likely play of scissors.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {19: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a simple static strategy, possibly choosing their plays randomly or based on a fixed pattern.', 'value': 0.4659, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 17: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.02429099999999995, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history. 
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between. 
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm. 
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice? 
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock. 
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy. 
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {19: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a simple static strategy, possibly choosing their plays randomly or based on a fixed pattern.', 'value': 0.4659, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 17: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.02429099999999995, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is playing a static strategy. They have consistently played rock in the majority of the rounds, and I have received positive rewards when countering their plays. Therefore, I hypothesize that my opponent is always playing rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing rock, it is likely that their next play will also be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock again, my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy. They have consistently played "rock" in the majority of the rounds, and I have consistently received positive rewards when playing "paper" against their "rock." This suggests that my opponent may be consistently playing "rock" as their strategy, allowing me to exploit this by consistently playing "paper" to counter their choice.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {19: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a simple static strategy, possibly choosing their plays randomly or based on a fixed pattern.', 'value': 0.13829100000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history. 
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between. 
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm. 
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice? 
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock. 
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {19: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a simple static strategy, possibly choosing their plays randomly or based on a fixed pattern.', 'value': 0.13829100000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent's strategy is not adapting to my plays. They have played paper consistently in the last few rounds, and I have been getting positive rewards when playing rock. This suggests that the opponent may be playing a static strategy, possibly always choosing paper.

Based on this observation, my hypothesis is:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the history of the opponent's plays and the fact that they have been playing paper consistently, it is likely that they will continue with paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, you should play scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

My opponent has consistently played paper for the past few rounds, and I have been consistently rewarded with a positive score when playing scissors. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing paper. Given this pattern, I can exploit this by consistently playing rock to counter their paper choice and maximize my rewards.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing paper, their likely play in the next round will be paper, assuming their strategy remains the same.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, your next play should be scissors to beat their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
