                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history. 
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent played "rock" and I played "scissors", resulting in a negative reward for me. This suggests that my opponent's play of "rock" is countering my play of "scissors", leading to a negative reward. It seems like my opponent may be playing a static strategy, always choosing "rock" regardless of my play. 

Based on this observation, I hypothesize that my opponent is consistently playing "rock" in each round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be rock.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, my opponent played rock in the first round and scissors in the second round. In both cases, they won and received a positive reward. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy where they always play the same move, regardless of my play. 

Given this, my opponent's likely policy is to always play the move that beats my previous play. In this case, they played rock when I played scissors, and scissors when I played paper. This indicates a pattern of countering my previous move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent is likely playing a static strategy of countering my previous move.'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy of countering my previous move, their likely play in the next round will be rock.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Given the interaction history, it seems that my opponent has consistently played rock, scissors, and scissors in the first three rounds. This suggests that they might be playing a static strategy rather than adapting to my choices. 

Looking at the rewards, I have received negative rewards for playing paper twice. This indicates that my opponent's strategy might be to play the winning move against paper, which is scissors.

Based on this observation, I hypothesize that my opponent's strategy is to play the move that beats my previous move. In this case, they are likely playing the counter strategy to my previous move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent seems to be playing the counter strategy to my previous move.'

My opponent's likely policy seems to be playing a static strategy of countering my previous move. In the first round, I played scissors and my opponent played rock, resulting in a negative reward for me. In the second and third rounds, I played paper and my opponent played scissors, resulting in negative rewards for me. However, in the fourth round, I played paper and my opponent played rock, resulting in a positive reward for me.

Based on this observation, it seems that my opponent is consistently countering my previous move. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of countering my previous move rather than adapting to my strategy.

```python

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent seems to be playing the counter strategy to my previous move.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not consistently playing a static strategy. However, based on the previous hypothesis, it appears that my opponent is playing a counter strategy to my previous move. In the last round, my opponent and I both played "rock," resulting in a tie (reward: 0). This aligns with the previous hypothesis that my opponent is countering my previous move.

Given this, I will refine my hypothesis to emphasize that my opponent is likely playing a counter strategy to my previous move, and I will use this information to inform my strategy for the next round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent seems to be playing the counter strategy to my previous move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent seems to be playing the counter strategy to my previous move, and the fact that they played rock in the last round, it is likely that they will play paper in the next round to counter my rock play.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, I should play scissors to counter their expected paper play.
```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is playing a counter strategy to my previous move. In the last round, I played scissors and received a positive reward. Looking at the previous hypotheses, it seems that my opponent's likely policy is to play the counter strategy to my previous move. This means that they are likely to play paper in the next round, as it would be a counter to my previous move of scissors.

Hypothesis Summary:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent seems to be playing the counter strategy to my previous move.',
'value': 0.3,
'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's apparent counter strategy to your previous move and the fact that they played 'paper' in the last round, it is likely that they will play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of 'scissors' in the next round, your next play should be 'rock' to counter their move.

Top hypotheses: {5: {'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent seems to be playing the counter strategy to my previous move.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is playing a strategy that counters my previous move. In the last round, I played "rock" and my opponent played "paper," resulting in a negative reward for me. Looking at the previous hypotheses, it seems that my opponent's likely policy is to play the counter strategy to my previous move.

Step by step reasoning:
1. In round 6, I played "rock" and my opponent played "paper," countering my move.
2. In the previous hypothesis, it was stated that my opponent seems to be playing the counter strategy to my previous move, with a predicted next play of "paper" in response to my next play being "scissors."

Based on this, it seems that my opponent is likely playing a strategy that counters my previous move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent seems to be playing the counter strategy to my previous move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent seems to be playing the counter strategy to my previous move, and considering their last play of paper, they may anticipate that I will play scissors to counter their paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of paper in the next round, I should play scissors to counter this and win the round.
```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {5: {'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent seems to be playing the counter strategy to my previous move.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not adapting their strategy and is playing a static policy. They have played 'rock' twice, 'scissors' twice, and 'paper' four times. I have received positive rewards when playing 'scissors' and 'rock', and negative rewards when playing 'paper'. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy and I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

Based on the previous hypothesis and the observed data, it seems that my opponent is playing a static strategy where they are not adapting to my plays. They are likely playing a simple rotation strategy where they play 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors' in a cyclic manner. This allows me to exploit their strategy by playing the counter move to their previous play.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent seems to be playing a simple rotation strategy of rock, paper, scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's simple rotation strategy, their likely play in the next round will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock, your next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent has played "paper" in the last two rounds, resulting in a tie both times. This suggests that they may be following a static strategy, as they have not adapted their play based on my choices. Since I have not consistently received positive rewards when playing the same choice, it is likely that my opponent is not playing a static strategy to exploit my choices.

Based on the observed data, it seems that my opponent's strategy is not based on countering my specific plays. Therefore, I hypothesize that my opponent may be playing randomly or following a simple pattern that does not directly target my choices.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing randomly or following a simple pattern that does not target my specific choices.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the history of the opponent's plays and the fact that their strategy is perceived to be random or following a simple pattern, it is likely that their next play will also be random or follow the same simple pattern, without targeting your specific choices.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the perceived random or simple pattern-following strategy of the opponent, it is best to play a strategy that covers all possibilities. In this case, it would be best to play rock, as it is a balanced choice that covers both paper and scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is playing a static strategy of alternating between rock and paper. This is evident from the fact that they have played rock twice in a row. Additionally, my opponent's likely policy is to play the same choice every time, which is rock in this case. This suggests a static strategy rather than a complex one to counter my moves.

I am getting a neutral reward (0) when playing the same choice as my opponent. This indicates that my opponent may be playing a static strategy, and I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a static strategy of alternating between rock and paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a static strategy of alternating between rock and paper, I believe their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play paper, I believe my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing randomly or following a simple pattern that does not target my specific choices.', 'value': 0.15990000000000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 9: {'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent seems to be playing a static strategy of playing rock or paper consistently.', 'value': 0.08787000000000006, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is playing a static strategy of consistently countering my plays. They have consistently played rock and scissors in the last few rounds, and I have received negative rewards when playing paper. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of countering my paper play with scissors.

Therefore, my hypothesis is:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is consistently countering my paper play with scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's consistent strategy of countering your paper play with scissors, it is likely that they will continue with scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering the opponent's likely play of scissors, you should play rock in the next round to counter their expected move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not playing a static strategy. They have played rock, scissors, paper, and rock in the last four rounds, and their choices do not seem to follow a consistent pattern. Additionally, I have received both positive and negative rewards when playing the same choice, indicating that my opponent is not consistently playing a single winning strategy.

Given this information, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific strategy that my opponent is following. It is possible that they are playing randomly or using a more complex strategy that is not immediately discernible from the limited interaction history.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'It is difficult to discern a specific pattern in my opponent's plays. Their strategy seems unpredictable and may not follow a consistent pattern.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's recent plays and the fact that they have won the last two rounds, it is likely that they will continue with their winning strategy and play scissors in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Considering the opponent's likely play of scissors, your next play should be rock to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent has played "rock" in the last two rounds, resulting in a tie both times. This suggests that they might be following a static strategy, always playing "rock" regardless of my play. Since I am getting a reward of 0 when playing the same choice as my opponent, it seems likely that they are playing a static strategy. 

Based on this observation, I hypothesize that my opponent is always playing "rock."

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing rock and the fact that they played rock in the last round, it is likely that they will continue to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock, your next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {16: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 12: {'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent seems to be consistently playing rock.', 'value': 0.045899999999999996, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing rock. In the last interaction at round 16, my opponent played rock, and I played paper, resulting in a positive reward for me. Looking at the previous interactions, my opponent has played rock in 14 out of 17 rounds, and I have consistently received positive rewards when playing paper against their rock. Therefore, I hypothesize that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always choosing rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing rock, their likely play in the next round will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, your next play should be paper to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, I can see that my opponent played "scissors" in the last round and won against my "paper." Looking at the previous rounds, I see that my opponent has consistently won when I played "paper." This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always countering my previous move.

Therefore, my hypothesis is that my opponent is playing a static strategy of countering my previous move. Specifically, they are likely playing the strategy of always choosing the move that beats my previous move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a static strategy of countering my previous move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's static strategy of countering your previous move, and considering that you played paper in the last round, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to counter your paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock in the next round, your next play should be scissors to counter their expected move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent's likely policy seems to be playing a static strategy. They have played rock, scissors, and paper in the last three rounds, and I have received positive rewards each time. This suggests that they might be playing a fixed sequence of rock, scissors, and paper. 

Based on this observation, I hypothesize that my opponent is playing a cyclic strategy of rock, scissors, paper. This means they are repeating the sequence in a loop, and I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy in the next round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a cyclic strategy of rock, scissors, paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's cyclic strategy of rock, scissors, paper and the fact that you played scissors last, their likely play in the next round will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, your next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not playing a static strategy. They have played rock, paper, and scissors in different rounds, and the rewards have been both positive and negative. There is no clear pattern indicating a static strategy.

Given the mixed plays and rewards, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific strategy. It is possible that my opponent is playing randomly or using a dynamic strategy that does not follow a simple pattern.

As there is no clear indication of a static strategy and the rewards are mixed, it is challenging to form a specific hypothesis about my opponent's likely policy at this point.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'It is difficult to determine a specific strategy based on the mixed plays and rewards observed so far.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's previous play of scissors and the lack of a discernible pattern in their strategy, it is difficult to predict their next play with certainty. However, considering their recent play of scissors, they might stick to the same play or switch to rock as a counter to your paper play.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the potential plays of scissors or rock by the opponent, your next play should be either rock or scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not following a specific pattern or strategy. The plays and rewards observed so far do not indicate a clear trend or consistent behavior. There is no evidence of a static strategy or a cyclic pattern that my opponent is following.

Given the lack of a discernible pattern and the mixed plays and rewards, it is difficult to determine a specific strategy that my opponent is playing. The previous hypotheses have not provided a clear explanation for the observed data.

Therefore, it is likely that my opponent is not following a static policy and may not be consistently playing the same choice. The lack of consistent positive or negative rewards for specific plays suggests that my opponent's strategy is not easily predictable based on the observed data.

As a result, I will need to adapt my strategy to be more flexible and responsive to my opponent's plays, rather than relying on a specific counter strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'It is difficult to determine a specific strategy based on the mixed plays and rewards observed so far.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the history of the opponent's plays and the lack of a discernible pattern, it is difficult to predict their next play with certainty. However, based on their previous plays, there is an equal chance of them playing rock, paper, or scissors in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the uncertainty in the opponent's next play, it would be best to play a random move to maintain unpredictability and avoid falling into a pattern.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {19: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a cyclic strategy of rock, scissors, paper.', 'value': 0.363, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent seems to be playing a simple rotation strategy of rock, paper, scissors.', 'value': 0.23849099999999995, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is playing a cyclic strategy of rock, scissors, paper. This is supported by the fact that they have played rock, scissors, and paper in a cyclical manner in the previous rounds. Additionally, my opponent's plays do not seem to be influenced by my own plays, as there is no clear pattern of countering my choices.

Given this, I believe my opponent's likely policy is to play in a cyclic manner, rotating through rock, scissors, and paper. This static strategy allows me to exploit their choices by playing the counter strategy in each round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a cyclic strategy of rock, scissors, paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the cyclic strategy of rock, scissors, paper, and the fact that the opponent's last play was scissors, their likely play in the next round will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely play in the next round is rock, your next play should be paper to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent has played scissors twice in a row and has received positive rewards both times. This suggests that they may have a static strategy of playing scissors consistently. As a result, I can exploit this by playing rock consistently to counter their strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the previous interaction history and the opponent's consistent play of scissors, it is likely that their next play will also be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors again, my next play should be rock to counter their play.

            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'It is difficult to determine a specific strategy based on the mixed plays and rewards observed so far.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {23: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing scissors.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 20: {'Opponent_strategy': 'It is difficult to determine a specific strategy based on the mixed plays and rewards observed so far.', 'value': 0.045899999999999996, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not playing a static strategy. The plays and rewards observed so far do not indicate a consistent pattern that would suggest a simple static policy. Additionally, the rewards for my plays have been mixed, with positive and negative rewards for different choices, indicating that my opponent is not consistently playing a single choice.

Given the mixed plays and rewards observed, it is difficult to determine a specific strategy based on the data so far. The previous hypotheses about my opponent's strategy have not provided a clear explanation for their plays.

Therefore, it is likely that my opponent is employing a mixed or random strategy, rather than a static or adaptive one. This means that they may be playing different choices randomly, without a clear pattern or consistent strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'It is difficult to determine a specific strategy based on the mixed plays and rewards observed so far.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's previous plays and the fact that they have played scissors twice in a row, it is likely that their next play will be rock, as they may be trying to mix up their strategy.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, your next play should be paper to counter their expected move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history. 
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between. 
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm. 
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice? 
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock. 
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

My opponent's likely policy seems to be a static strategy, as they have played the same move multiple times without adapting. Looking at the interaction history, I have received positive rewards when playing rock and scissors, and negative rewards when playing paper. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always playing paper. 

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the previous interaction history and the opponent's consistent play of paper, it is likely that the opponent will continue to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, you should play scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent seems to be playing a simple rotation strategy of rock, paper, scissors.', 'value': 0.31736168909999996, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 23: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing scissors.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 20: {'Opponent_strategy': 'It is difficult to determine a specific strategy based on the mixed plays and rewards observed so far.', 'value': 0.11249100000000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'It is difficult to determine a specific strategy based on the mixed plays and rewards observed so far.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is playing a static strategy. In the last interaction, both my opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie (reward of 0). Looking at the overall history, I have received positive rewards when playing rock and paper, but negative rewards when playing scissors. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always countering my plays.

Therefore, I hypothesize that my opponent is always playing the counter to my previous play. This means if I play rock, they play paper; if I play paper, they play scissors; and if I play scissors, they play rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing the counter to my previous play.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing the counter to your previous play, and considering that you played scissors in the last round, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock in the next round, your next play should be paper to counter their likely move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is playing a static strategy. They have played paper in the last three rounds, resulting in a tie each time. This suggests that they may be consistently playing paper. As a result, I can exploit this by playing scissors in the next round to counter their paper play and gain a positive reward.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the history of the opponent's plays and the fact that they have played paper in the last few rounds, it seems likely that they may continue to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not adapting their strategy and is likely playing a static policy. I have observed that whenever I play scissors, I consistently receive positive rewards. This suggests that my opponent may have a tendency to play paper more often than rock or scissors.

Based on this observation, I hypothesize that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy where they favor paper as their choice more often than rock or scissors.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing paper, their likely play in the next round will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```
