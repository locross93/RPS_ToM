                An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 1, {'round': 0, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}.
                The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}].
                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history. 
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between. 
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm. 
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice? 
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock. 
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy. 
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing scissors.'
                }
                ```
                
                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent played "paper" and I played "scissors", resulting in a positive reward for me. This suggests that my opponent is not playing a static strategy, as they did not consistently play the same move. Since I received a positive reward for playing "scissors", it's possible that my opponent is playing a strategy that is weak against scissors. 

Based on this observation, my hypothesis is that my opponent may have a tendency to play "rock" more often, as "rock" would lose to my "scissors". I will continue to observe their plays to refine this hypothesis further.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent may have a tendency to play rock more often.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent played paper in the last round and my previous guess about their strategy, it is likely that they will continue to play paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to continue playing paper, my next play should be rock to beat their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent has played rock twice in a row, resulting in a tie and a zero reward for me. This suggests that they may be playing a static strategy of always choosing rock. If this pattern continues, I can exploit it by consistently playing paper to counter their rock. 

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent's strategy seems to be always playing rock, I believe their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play rock again, I believe my next play should be paper.
```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```
