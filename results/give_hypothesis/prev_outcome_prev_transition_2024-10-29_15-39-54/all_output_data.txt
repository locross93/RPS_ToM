            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where both played the same move (rock), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round where they played 'paper' against my 'scissors'. According to the strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to their move in the preceding round, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'paper' and lost, they are likely to play 'rock' next to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper' to beat their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing scissors against my paper. According to their strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my previous move (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter move is paper, as paper beats rock.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing paper against my rock. According to the strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my previous move (rock), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move (paper). Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my best counter move is rock, as rock beats scissors.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing paper against my rock. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the move that would beat my previous move, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I won with scissors against the opponent's paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would lose to their move in the preceding round (paper loses to rock, which was my play two rounds ago), the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing scissors against my paper. According to their strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat their move in the preceding round, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter move is to play paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they have been consistently playing 'scissors' after my 'paper' in the last several rounds, resulting in their wins. According to the strategy, after a win where they played the move that beats my previous move, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, if they played 'scissors' last round, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they have been consistently playing scissors after winning against my paper. Since they won the last round with scissors, I predict they will continue to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they played 'rock' in the last round and won. According to the strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat their move in the preceding round, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'rock' last, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round where they played scissors against my rock. According to the strategy, after a loss in which the opponent played the move that would lose to their move in the preceding round, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat their move in the preceding round (opponent played rock to beat my scissors), they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move is paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round where they played rock against my paper. According to the strategy, after a loss where the opponent played the move that would lose to their move in the preceding round, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the outcome was a tie with both of us playing paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as their move in the preceding round, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent's next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors in the next round, my best counter-move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my previous move (rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move (paper). Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing paper against my rock. According to the strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my previous move, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing paper against my rock. According to the strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my previous move (rock), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter this.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to my previous guess about the opponent's strategy, after a tie in which the opponent played the same move as their move in the preceding round, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock in the next round, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my last move (rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move (paper). Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 1.

According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie in which the opponent played the same move as their move in the preceding round, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, I should play rock in the next round.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my last move (scissors beats paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my previous move (scissors beats paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my previous move, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and won against my paper. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my previous move (scissors beats paper), they will likely play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as their previous move, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent's next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock in the next round, I should play paper to counter this, as paper beats rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my last move (scissors beats paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move, which is rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter is to play paper.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing scissors against my paper. According to the strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat their move in the preceding round, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they have been consistently playing scissors after winning with scissors against my paper. Given this pattern, it is likely that their next play will be scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round with scissors against my rock. According to the strategy, after a loss where the opponent played the move that would lose to their move in the preceding round, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play paper next.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, I should play scissors.
