            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing scissors, which beats my previous play of paper. According to their strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter move is paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my best counter-move is 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss where they played the same move as two rounds ago. In the last round, they played 'scissors', which was the same as two rounds ago, and they won. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will likely play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they have consistently played 'scissors' for the last five rounds, which indicates a pattern. According to the strategy, after a loss where the opponent played the same move as the previous round, they would play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to win the round.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they have been consistently playing 'scissors' after my 'paper' plays, which have resulted in their wins. According to the strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they should play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'scissors' last, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy and the last interaction, the opponent played 'scissors' in the last round and the round before that. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the same move in the last round as two rounds ago, the opponent will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and the opponent played 'rock', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Since they played 'rock' last, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors', which resulted in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to win the round.

```python

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played paper against my scissors), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter this.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round and played 'rock', which would beat my move two rounds ago ('scissors'). According to the strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my best counter-move is 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round and played scissors, which would beat my play from two rounds ago (paper). According to the strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

According to their strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move from two rounds ago, they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter their move.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (round 50: scissors vs paper), they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round and played rock, which would beat my play from two rounds ago (scissors). According to their strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move from two rounds ago, they will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (paper), they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the last few rounds. In round 58, the opponent played 'paper' after a tie with 'paper', which means they repeated their move. In round 59, they played 'paper' again after winning with 'paper' against my 'rock'. In round 60, they played 'paper' again after winning with 'paper' against my 'rock'. According to the strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be to play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played 'rock' against my 'paper'), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my best move would be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors, which beat my paper. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (rock in round 69 and rock in round 67), the opponent will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round and played scissors, which would beat my play from two rounds ago (rock). According to their strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move from two rounds ago, they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (round 72: rock vs. rock), they will play the same move as in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played paper, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (paper beats rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played paper in the last round, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my last move (rock), they tend to play the move that would beat their last move. Since they played 'paper' and won, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock'.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played rock, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, I should play scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where both played the same move (scissors), the opponent will likely play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of rock, I should play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where both played scissors, the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (rock beats scissors), they tend to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (round 95: opponent played 'paper' against my 'rock'), they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter this.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing 'paper' against my 'rock'. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (which was 'paper'), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play 'scissors' again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my best counter move is 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, we had a tie with both playing 'paper'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock'.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round and played scissors, which would beat my play two rounds ago (rock). According to their strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago. In round 109, they played 'paper' which beat my 'rock' from round 108. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it beats 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as it beats 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 1.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they just won with scissors against my paper. According to the strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the last few rounds. In round 115, the opponent played scissors, which beat my paper from round 114. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent's move would beat my move from two rounds ago, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, after playing scissors and winning, the opponent is likely to play rock next.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they have been consistently playing scissors after winning against my paper. Given the pattern, it is likely they will continue to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, which will beat scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they played 'paper' in the last round and won. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (which was 'paper'), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock' to win the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (round 121: opponent played paper, I played rock), they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my best move would be scissors.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy and the last interaction, where I played scissors and they played paper (resulting in my win), the opponent's strategy suggests that after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing rock against my scissors. According to the strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago. In the last round, they won by playing scissors against my paper. Two rounds ago, they played rock, which would beat my scissors. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play the move that would beat scissors, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played rock, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, I should play scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and won against my 'paper'. Two rounds ago, they played 'scissors' as well, which would beat my 'scissors' from that round. According to their strategy, they will likely play 'rock' next, as it beats 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. Two rounds ago, they played 'paper', which would lose to 'rock'. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', I should play 'paper' to counter this and win the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played scissors (which beats my paper), they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing 'paper' against my 'rock'. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'paper', they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be to play 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing 'paper' against my 'rock'. According to the strategy, after a win where they played a move that beats my last move, they will play the move that beats their last move. Therefore, their next play is likely to be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (rock beats scissors), they are likely to play the same move again, which is rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing scissors against my paper. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent's move beats my move from two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter move should be paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'paper' and won against the opponent's 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss in which they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (which was 'scissors'), they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'rock', my best move is 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing paper against my rock. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, I should play rock to counter it.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (rock beats scissors), they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and two rounds ago, they also played 'paper'. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (rock beats scissors), they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter their move.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to adapt their play based on the previous outcome and transition. In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and won against my 'paper'. According to their strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (which was 'scissors'), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they played 'scissors' in the last round and 'scissors' in the round before that. According to the strategy, after a win where they played the same move in the last round as two rounds ago, they will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing paper against my rock. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my best counter move is rock, as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago (rock in round 177 and rock in round 176), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'paper' and the opponent played 'scissors', resulting in my loss. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'scissors' last round, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'rock' and won against the opponent's 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (which was 'paper'), they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played scissors (which beats my previous paper), they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost because I played 'paper'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play 'rock' again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my best counter-move is 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played paper, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played paper, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my best counter-move is to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago (rock), they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round and played 'rock', which would beat my 'scissors' from two rounds ago. According to their strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and won. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (I played 'rock' in round 204), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move is to play 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (rock in round 209 and rock in round 207), the opponent is likely to play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their move.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round where they played 'paper' against my 'scissors'. According to the strategy, after a loss where the opponent played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that beats their last move after a win. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it beats 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round where they played 'rock' against my 'paper'. According to the strategy, after a loss where the opponent played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (they played 'rock' which beats 'scissors' from round 216), they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move is 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and the opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter this and win the round.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. In round 222, they played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. Two rounds ago, in round 220, they played 'paper' against my 'rock'. Therefore, they will likely play 'scissors' next to beat their last move, 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round where they played 'rock' against my 'paper'. According to their strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (round 224, they played 'rock' which lost to my 'scissors'), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they just won with scissors against my paper. According to the strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors against paper), they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, their next likely play is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (paper beats rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played paper in the last round, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost because I played 'paper'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (round 236: opponent played 'rock' against my 'scissors'), they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play 'rock' again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both I and my opponent played 'paper', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that my opponent's next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'scissors', my best counter move is 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to adapt their next move based on the outcome of the previous round. In the last round (round 243), the opponent played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to the strategy, after a loss where the opponent's move would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter their move and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (rock against paper), they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter-move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the outcome was a tie with both players playing paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (paper), they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (paper beats rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played paper last round, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock.

```python

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (which was 'scissors'), they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play 'rock' again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my best counter move is 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (paper beats rock), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played paper last round, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played rock against my paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play paper, my best counter move is scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be paper.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to adapt their play based on the previous outcomes and transitions. In the last round, the opponent played scissors and won against my paper. According to their strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors against paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last, they are likely to play rock next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where the opponent played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (paper beats rock), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played paper last round, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (paper beats rock), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played paper last round, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 1.

Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter it.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago (rock), they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of paper, I should play scissors.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing scissors against my paper. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter it.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they have been consistently playing 'scissors' after winning against my 'paper'. In the last round, they won with 'scissors' against my 'paper'. According to their strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my previous move, they tend to play the move that would beat their last move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play scissors after winning with scissors against my paper. Since they have consistently played scissors in the last several rounds and won, they are likely to continue playing scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, which beats scissors.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (round 292: opponent played scissors, round 293: opponent played paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my best counter-move is 'paper' to win the round.
