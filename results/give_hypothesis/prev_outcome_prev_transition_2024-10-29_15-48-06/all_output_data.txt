            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy and the fact that the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

Response: 1.

Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing 'rock', which beat my 'scissors'. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (which was 'scissors' in round 10), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter it.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they have been consistently winning by playing scissors against my paper for the last four rounds. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the move that would beat their move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will likely play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round, my best counter-move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

After a win in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as they played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.     After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat their move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.    After a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to their move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.     After a loss in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as they played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.     After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat their move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.    After a tie in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would lose to their move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.     After a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as they played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move.': 1.0}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to their move two rounds ago (scissors against paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors in the last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```
