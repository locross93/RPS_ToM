            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round and played scissors, which would lose to the move I played two rounds ago (paper). According to their strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (rock in round 5 and rock in round 3), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent's next play is predicted to be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter this.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the same move again. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. Two rounds ago, they played 'rock' against my 'scissors', which would beat my move two rounds ago. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (rock beats scissors), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played rock last, they will likely play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter is to play scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, since they won the last round by playing 'paper' against my 'rock', and they played 'paper' in the previous round as well, they are likely to play the same move again, which is 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next, as it beats their last move 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter their move and win the next round.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the last few rounds. In round 30, the opponent played 'paper' after a tie with 'paper' in round 29. In round 31, they played 'paper' again after winning with 'paper' against my 'rock' in round 30. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' from the opponent, I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss where they played the same move as two rounds ago. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'. Two rounds ago, they played 'rock' as well. According to their strategy, after a win where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', I should play 'paper' to counter it and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'paper', and it resulted in a tie. According to the guessed strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, the opponent will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock' in the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' which beat my 'rock'. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it beats 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as it beats 'scissors'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the same move again. In the last round, they played 'paper' which beat my 'rock' from two rounds ago. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (paper beats rock), they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played paper last round, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (rock), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is scissors.
   
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round, my best counter move would be to play rock.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they played 'paper' in the last round and 'paper' in the round before that, which resulted in a win for them. According to the strategy, after a win where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (rock in round 50 and rock in round 52), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter this.

```python

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the last few rounds. In round 57, the opponent played 'rock' after a tie in round 56, where both played 'rock'. According to the strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. However, in round 58, the opponent played 'rock' again after winning with 'rock' against my 'scissors'. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

According to their strategy, after a win where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (round 59: opponent played rock, which beats my scissors from round 58), they are likely to play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play rock, my best counter move is paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the last few rounds. In round 64, I played rock and the opponent played paper, resulting in my loss. In round 65, I again played rock and the opponent played paper, resulting in another loss for me. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played paper in round 65 and won, they are likely to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round, my best counter-move would be to play rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they have been consistently playing 'paper' after winning against my 'rock'. Since they won the last round with 'paper', and their strategy suggests they will play the same move after a win where they played the move that would beat my last move, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter move is 'scissors', as it beats 'paper'.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played 'rock', resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the same move again. In round 68, the opponent played 'rock', which was the same move they played in round 67. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
