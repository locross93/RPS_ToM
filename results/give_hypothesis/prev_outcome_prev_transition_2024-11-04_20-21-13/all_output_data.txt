            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (which is not applicable here since it's the first round), the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'scissors' last round, they are likely to play 'rock' next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', I should play 'paper' to counter it.

According to the strategy, after a loss where the opponent played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (which was 'rock'), they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter it.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors vs. paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper to beat their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. In round 15, they played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. In round 14, they played 'paper', which would lose to my 'rock' from round 13. Therefore, according to their strategy, they will play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', I should play 'paper' to counter this and win the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they have been playing 'rock' for the last three rounds after winning against my 'scissors'. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to win the round.

According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move is to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round with 'paper' against my 'scissors'. According to the strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (round 30, they played 'paper' which lost to my 'rock'), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock' to beat their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and won against my 'paper'. According to the guessed strategy, after a win where the opponent's move would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'scissors' last, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (paper beats rock), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played paper last round, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'rock' and won against the opponent's 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played 'scissors' which loses to my 'rock' from two rounds ago), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move is 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (they played 'scissors' which beats 'paper' from round 43), they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my best counter-move is to play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round and played 'scissors', which would beat my play two rounds ago ('scissors'). According to their strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (rock), the opponent will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play paper next.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the same move again. In the last round, they played 'rock' which beat my 'scissors' from two rounds ago. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to beat their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round and played 'paper', which would beat my move two rounds ago ('scissors'). According to their strategy, after a loss in which they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the outcome was a tie with both of us playing paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter-move would be to play rock.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'. Two rounds ago, they played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'. According to their strategy, they will play the move that beats 'paper', which is 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter would be to play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (scissors), the opponent will likely play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (both were 'paper'), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played paper against my scissors), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round by playing rock against my scissors. According to their strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they just won the last round by playing scissors against my paper. According to the strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move from two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter it.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (rock beats scissors), they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since they played 'rock' in the last round and lost, they are likely to play 'rock' again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where both played rock, the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played rock, they might play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent's strategy suggests that after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. In round 81, they played 'rock' which beat my 'scissors' from round 80. According to the strategy, they should play 'paper' next, as it beats 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors, which beat my paper. Therefore, I predict their next move will be rock, as it beats scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (they played 'rock' which beats 'scissors' from round 86), they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move is 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'paper' last round, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be to play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my last move, they tend to play the move that would beat their last move. In the last round, they played 'paper' which beat my 'rock'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it beats 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing 'paper' against my 'rock'. According to the strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round by playing 'paper' against my 'scissors'. According to their strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their move.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as they did two rounds ago (both were 'paper'), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to adapt their play based on the previous outcome and transition. In the last round, the opponent won by playing 'rock' against my 'scissors'. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (paper beats rock), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played paper last round, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, I should play rock to counter this.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago (rock), they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would beat their last move. Since they played scissors last, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss where they played the same move as two rounds ago. In round 115, they played 'paper' which beat my 'rock'. In round 114, they played 'paper' as well, which tied with my 'paper'. According to their strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they have been consistently playing 'paper' after winning against my 'rock'. Since they won the last round with 'paper', and their strategy suggests that after a win where they played a move that beats my previous move, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (both were 'rock'), the opponent is likely to play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and my opponent played rock, resulting in my win. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played rock last, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, I should play scissors to counter it.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they have been consistently playing 'paper' after my 'rock' plays, which results in their win. Given the pattern and the last round where they played 'paper' against my 'rock', it is likely they will continue with 'paper' in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely 'paper' play, I should play 'scissors' in the next round to secure a win.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (both were 'rock'), the opponent is likely to play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and won. Two rounds ago, they played 'rock' again. According to their strategy, they will play the move that beats 'rock', which is 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to win the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play rock in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (rock), they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their move.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (paper in round 143 and paper in round 145), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy and the last round's tie where both played rock, the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent's next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my next play should be paper to counter this.

```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they have been consistently playing scissors after winning against my paper. Given their pattern of repeating the same move after a win where their move beats my previous move, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 1.

In the last round, they played scissors, which beat my paper. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter this.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors against paper), they will play the move that beats their last move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing 'paper' against my 'rock'. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'paper', they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (rock beats scissors), they tend to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago (paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter this.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors against rock), they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss where they played the same move as two rounds ago. In the last round, they played scissors, which beat my paper, and two rounds ago they also played scissors. According to their strategy, they will play the move that would lose to their last round's move, which is paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round where they played 'rock' against my 'paper'. According to the strategy, after a loss where the opponent played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter-move is 'scissors' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Since the opponent played 'scissors' in both rounds 180 and 182, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my next play should be 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both my opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play rock in the next round, I should play paper to counter it and win.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move in the last round as they did two rounds ago (both were scissors), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, their next play is predicted to be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter this.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago (both rounds were scissors), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move should be paper to beat their rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In round 192, they played scissors and won against my paper. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next, as it beats scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago. In the last round, they played scissors and won against my paper. Two rounds ago, they played scissors as well, which would beat my paper from three rounds ago. Therefore, following their strategy, they are likely to play rock next, as it beats their last move, scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and won against my 'paper'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (which was 'scissors' against my 'scissors'), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (paper against rock), they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played paper, which lost to my scissors. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter-move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In round 208, they played 'rock' which lost to my 'paper' in round 209. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' next to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. In round 210, they played scissors, which beat my paper in round 211. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next, as it beats scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter is to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played scissors last, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (since I played 'scissors' in round 218), they will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round by playing rock against my scissors. According to their strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move is paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as the previous round (scissors), they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and won against my 'paper'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (which was 'paper'), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', I should play 'paper' to counter it and win the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move again. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play 'scissors' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter it and secure a win.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (rock in round 233), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played rock in the last round, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of rock, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors vs. paper), they tend to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (rock), the opponent will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their move.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move in the last round as they did two rounds ago (both were scissors), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent's next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, resulting in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of rock, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (rock beats scissors), they are likely to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to adapt their play based on the previous outcome and their last move. In the last round, they won by playing scissors against my paper. According to their strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my last move (rock), they tend to play the move that would beat their last move (paper). Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (paper beats rock), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played paper last round, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors vs. rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Since the opponent played 'paper' in the last two rounds, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock'.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they won the last round by playing paper against my rock. According to the strategy, after a win where the opponent played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my last move (rock) with paper, they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move, which is scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round and played scissors, which would beat my play two rounds ago (scissors). According to their strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my best counter move is to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the result was a tie with both of us playing paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Since they played paper, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', I should play 'paper'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, there was a tie with both of us playing paper. According to my understanding of the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my best counter move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round and played 'rock', which would beat my move two rounds ago ('scissors'). According to their strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my best counter move is 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played scissors (which beat my paper), they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won against my 'scissors'. Two rounds ago, they played 'rock' against my 'paper', which they lost. According to their strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and it resulted in a tie. According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last round's move. Since they played 'paper' in both the last and the round before, they will likely play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
