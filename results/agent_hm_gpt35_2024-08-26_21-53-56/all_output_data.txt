Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

The opponent played "paper" and received a reward of -1. This suggests that playing "rock" resulted in a negative reward. Therefore, the opponent may be playing a static strategy where they consistently play the winning move against "rock," which is "paper." 

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper to counter my rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of countering your rock with paper, their likely play in the next round will be paper again.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, your next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

Top hypotheses: {1: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper to counter my rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing paper. This is evident from their plays in both rounds 1 and 2. Additionally, I have received positive rewards when playing scissors, which indicates that my opponent's static strategy is to play paper consistently. 

Therefore, my hypothesis about my opponent's likely policy is:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper to counter my rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's consistent strategy of playing paper to counter your rock, it is likely that they will continue with paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Considering the opponent's likely play of paper, you should play rock in the next round to counter their strategy.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not adapting their strategy and is playing a static policy. They played paper, then scissors, and then I played rock and they played scissors again. This suggests that they may be playing a static strategy where they are not adapting to my choices. 

Given that I have received positive rewards when playing rock, it seems that my opponent may be playing a static strategy and I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy, which is paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing the same choice, and I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent's strategy is to always play the same choice, their likely play in the next round will be 'scissors' since they have played 'paper' and 'scissors' in the previous rounds.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent's likely play in the next round is 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently countering my rock plays with paper. This suggests a static strategy rather than an adaptive one. As a result, I am getting negative rewards when playing rock. Therefore, it is likely that my opponent is playing a static strategy of always countering my rock with paper.

My opponent's likely policy seems to be playing a static strategy, as they have consistently played "paper" in the last few rounds. I have received positive rewards every time I played "scissors" against their "paper." This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing "paper." I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy of "rock" in the next round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing paper, it is likely that their next play will also be paper, as they seem to be sticking to their strategy.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper again, your next play should be rock to beat their paper.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing rock. In the last interaction, my opponent played rock, and I played paper, resulting in a positive reward for me. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing rock.

Given this observation, I can exploit this by consistently playing the counter strategy, which is paper. By doing so, I can maximize my rewards by consistently winning against my opponent's predictable strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent has been consistently playing rock, it is likely that they will continue with rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to continue with rock, I should play paper in the next round to beat their rock.

            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 6, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 7, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}].
            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 7: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing rock. This is evident from the fact that in the last 8 rounds, they have played rock in 7 of them. Additionally, I have received positive rewards every time I played paper, indicating that my opponent's static strategy is vulnerable to paper.

Hypothesis:
Given the consistent pattern of my opponent playing rock and my positive rewards when countering with paper, I hypothesize that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always choosing rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing rock, their likely play in the next round will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not adapting their strategy and is likely playing a static policy. They have played paper consistently in the last few rounds, resulting in positive rewards for me when I played scissors and rock. Therefore, I hypothesize that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always choosing paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the previous plays of the opponent and your guess about their strategy, it seems likely that the opponent will continue to play paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, your next play should be scissors to counter their paper play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

My opponent has consistently played rock in the last few rounds, resulting in negative rewards for me. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing rock. Given the consistent pattern and negative rewards, it seems likely that my opponent is sticking to a simple, static strategy rather than adapting to my plays.

Based on this observation, I hypothesize that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always choosing rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent has consistently played rock in the last few rounds, it is likely that they will continue with rock in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to continue with rock, my next play should be paper to counter their choice.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.53793, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 7: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.4659, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.363, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

My opponent has consistently played rock in the last few rounds, and I have consistently received positive rewards when playing paper. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing rock. Given the consistent pattern and positive rewards, it seems likely that my opponent is not adapting their strategy and is simply playing rock every time.

Based on this observation, my hypothesis is:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent has been consistently playing rock, it is likely that they will continue with rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play rock again, I should play paper to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

My opponent has played "paper" in the last two rounds, resulting in a tie both times. This suggests that my opponent may be following a static strategy of always playing "paper". Given that I am getting a positive reward when playing "scissors" and "rock" against "paper", it is likely that my opponent is playing a static strategy. Therefore, I hypothesize that my opponent is always playing "paper".

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent has been consistently playing paper and my last play was also paper, it is likely that they will continue with paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to continue with paper, I should play scissors in the next round to counter their play.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent has consistently played rock in the last few rounds. This suggests that they might be following a static strategy of always playing rock. As a result, I have been receiving negative rewards when playing scissors, which is the counter to rock.

Therefore, my hypothesis is that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always choosing rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing rock, it is likely that their next play will also be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock again, you should play paper to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.54750999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 7: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.5228037, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.48750899999999997, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.4659, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 11: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.363, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

My opponent has consistently played rock in the last few rounds, and I have consistently received positive rewards when playing paper. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing rock. Given the consistent pattern and positive rewards, it seems likely that my opponent is not adapting their strategy and is playing a static policy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing rock, their likely play in the next round will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock, your next play should be paper to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not consistently playing the same choice. The previous hypotheses do not provide a clear explanation for the opponent's strategy. 

Given the interaction history, it appears that my opponent's strategy is not static and may not be easily predictable based on the previous plays. The opponent's plays seem to be varied, and there is no clear pattern indicating a static strategy.

I am not consistently getting positive rewards when playing the same choice, which suggests that my opponent may not be playing a static strategy. This makes it difficult to pinpoint a specific counter-strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'It is difficult to predict my opponent's strategy based on the observed plays.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent has played paper in the last round and has shown a tendency to repeat their plays, it is likely that they will play paper again in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, my next play should be scissors to beat their predicted paper play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

My opponent has consistently played rock in the last few rounds, and I have consistently played scissors, resulting in negative rewards. It seems like my opponent is playing a static strategy of always choosing rock. This gives me an opportunity to exploit their strategy by consistently playing paper, which will result in positive rewards for me.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing rock, their likely play in the next round would be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, your next play should be paper.
```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {13: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.05700000000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not consistently playing the same choice. The rewards I've received have been mixed, indicating that my opponent's strategy is not static. 

Given the recent plays of "paper" by my opponent and the previous hypothesis that my opponent is always playing rock, it's clear that the previous hypothesis is not accurate. The recent plays of "paper" by my opponent suggest that they might be playing in a way to counter my strategy, rather than following a static pattern.

Therefore, it's difficult to pinpoint a specific strategy my opponent is using at this point. I will need more data to form a more accurate hypothesis about their strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'It is unclear at this point what strategy my opponent is using.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is unclear and the last action you played was paper, it's difficult to predict their next play. However, based on the history of plays, there is a possibility that the opponent might choose rock or scissors in the next round to break the pattern of paper plays.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering the potential plays of the opponent, it would be strategic to choose scissors in the next round to counter a potential rock play by the opponent.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent has played scissors in the last two rounds and I have received a reward of 0 both times. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing scissors. If this pattern continues, I can exploit it by playing the counter strategy of always choosing rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the previous plays of the opponent and your guess about their strategy, it seems that they might continue to play scissors in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, you should play rock to counter their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not playing a static strategy. They have played paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, and paper in the previous rounds. There is no clear pattern or consistent play that suggests a static strategy.

My opponent's likely policy seems to be more random or reactive, as there is no consistent pattern in their plays. It's difficult to predict their next move based on the previous plays.

I am getting negative rewards when playing the same choice, as evident from the negative rewards received when playing rock and paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent does not follow a static strategy and their plays seem more random or reactive.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of being more random or reactive, it's difficult to predict their next play. However, considering their recent win with paper, they might stick with paper or switch to rock to counter your previous play of rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter their potential plays of paper or rock, you should play scissors to beat their paper or paper to beat their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not playing a static strategy. They have played paper multiple times, but they have also played rock and scissors. There is no clear pattern indicating a static strategy.

My opponent's likely policy seems to be random or based on a more complex strategy that I have not yet identified. They are not consistently playing the same choice, and my rewards have been mixed, indicating that they are not following a simple static strategy.

Given the lack of a clear pattern and the mixed rewards, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific strategy at this point. I will need more data to form a more accurate hypothesis about my opponent's strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'It is difficult to identify a clear pattern or static strategy in my opponent's plays.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent has played paper in the last round and there is no clear pattern in their strategy, it is difficult to predict their next play. However, since they have played paper twice in a row, they might switch to rock or scissors in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Considering the uncertainty in the opponent's strategy, it would be prudent to play rock in the next round as it can counter both paper and scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {20: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent does not follow a static strategy and their plays seem more random or reactive.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history. 
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between. 
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm. 
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice? 
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock. 
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {20: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent does not follow a static strategy and their plays seem more random or reactive.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent's plays are not following a static strategy and appear to be more random or reactive. However, there is a slight bias towards certain plays, as indicated by the previous hypothesis. In the last interaction, my opponent played scissors, and I played rock, resulting in a positive reward for me. This suggests that my opponent may not be adapting to my strategy and could be playing a static strategy.

Hypothesis:
Given the observed bias and the positive reward when playing the same choice, it is likely that my opponent is playing a biased static strategy, favoring certain plays. This bias could be exploited by playing the counter strategy to the most frequently played move by the opponent.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is biased towards playing scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's bias towards playing scissors and the fact that they lost in the previous round when you played rock, it is likely that they will play rock in the next round to counter your rock play.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock in the next round, you should play paper to counter their expected move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {22: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is biased towards playing scissors.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.11734476243870001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

My opponent's likely policy seems to be biased towards playing rock. Looking at the interaction history, I've received positive rewards every time I've played paper, indicating that my opponent is consistently playing rock. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing rock. 

Based on this observation, I can exploit this by consistently playing the counter strategy, which in this case would be scissors. 

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent has been consistently playing rock and my last play was paper, I predict that their next play will be rock. Since their strategy seems to be fixed on always playing rock, I expect them to continue with this pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play rock again, I should play paper in the next round to counter their rock play and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {18: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.06750900000000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

My opponent has played paper in the last three rounds, resulting in a tie each time. This suggests that my opponent may have a static strategy of always playing paper. Given this pattern, it seems likely that my opponent is consistently playing paper, regardless of my plays. As a result, I can exploit this by consistently playing scissors to counter their paper play and consistently win.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing paper, it is likely that they will continue to play paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of paper, your next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing "rock" and I am consistently receiving negative rewards when playing "scissors" against their "rock." This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing "rock."

Hypothesis:
Given the consistent negative reward when playing "scissors," I hypothesize that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always choosing "rock."

Summary:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent has been consistently playing rock and my last play was scissors, I believe their likely play in the next round will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper in the next round to counter their play.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {18: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.12307941, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

My opponent's likely policy given their plays seems to be playing a static strategy. They have played paper consistently in the last few rounds, resulting in a tie each time. This suggests that they might be sticking to a single choice rather than adapting to my strategy. Based on this observation, I hypothesize that my opponent is always playing paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the history of the opponent's plays and the fact that they have played paper in the last few rounds, it seems likely that they will continue to play paper in the next round, assuming they are following a fixed strategy.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, my next play should be scissors to beat their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent has played scissors for the last two rounds, resulting in a tie both times. This suggests that they may be playing a static strategy, as they are consistently choosing the same option. Since I am getting a neutral reward (0) when playing the same choice as my opponent, it indicates that they may not be adapting their strategy based on my choices.

Based on this observation, I hypothesize that my opponent is playing a static strategy and is likely to continue playing scissors in the next round as well.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing scissors, it is likely that they will continue to play scissors in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of scissors, you should play rock in the next round to counter their strategy.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not playing a static strategy. They have played paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, and paper in the last 8 rounds, indicating a lack of a consistent pattern. 

My previous hypotheses about my opponent always playing paper have not been consistent with the recent plays. Therefore, I need to reconsider my approach.

I will now consider the possibility that my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, where they choose their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution. This would explain the lack of a consistent pattern in their plays.

I am getting negative rewards when playing the same choice as my opponent, which suggests that they may not be playing a static strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's mixed strategy, it's difficult to predict their next play with certainty. However, based on the history, it seems that they might continue to play randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution. Considering your last play as rock, the opponent's likely play in the next round could be any of rock, paper, or scissors with equal probability.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the uncertainty in the opponent's strategy, it's best to adopt a mixed strategy as well. To counter the opponent's potential plays, you should play rock, paper, and scissors with equal probability.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between. 
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.

                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock. 
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {18: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.40521623763, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.39387, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.363, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing paper. This is evident from the fact that in the last 29 rounds, they have played paper 17 times. Additionally, my opponent's likely policy seems to be static, as they have not adapted their strategy based on my plays.

Given that my opponent is consistently playing paper, I can exploit this by playing scissors, which will result in me getting a positive reward every time I play scissors.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing paper and the fact that they won the last round when you played rock, they are likely to continue playing paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, you should play scissors in the next round to counter their play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always choosing paper. This is supported by the fact that in the last 5 rounds, they have consistently played paper, and I have consistently received positive rewards when playing scissors. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy, and I can exploit this by consistently playing rock to counter their paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {18: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.10855595643870009, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.10299630000000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.08787000000000006, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not following a static strategy. The plays seem to be varied, and there is no consistent pattern that would suggest a simple static policy. Additionally, the rewards for playing the same choice have been both positive and negative, indicating that there is no clear static strategy being employed.

Given the lack of a clear pattern and the mixed rewards, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific strategy that my opponent is following. It is possible that they are employing a more complex strategy to counter my plays, or they may be using a random or semi-random approach.

As such, I do not have a clear hypothesis about my opponent's strategy at this point.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I do not have a clear hypothesis about my opponent's strategy at this point.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent has played scissors in the last round and the interaction history, it seems that the opponent's strategy might be to play the same move as the previous round in case of a tie.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, my next play should be rock to counter their potential move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing paper. This is evident from the fact that in the last few rounds, they have consistently played paper, resulting in negative rewards for me when I played rock.

Therefore, my hypothesis is that my opponent is always playing paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing paper, their likely play in the next round will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {29: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.4659, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.', 'value': 0.39387, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 32: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 18: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.14319241865496302, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.14046818700000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always choosing paper. This is supported by the fact that in the last 33 rounds, my opponent has played paper 23 times, and I have consistently received positive rewards when playing scissors against their paper.

Hypothesis:
My opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always choosing paper.

I will use this hypothesis to inform my strategy in the next round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing paper, their likely play in the next round will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent's likely policy is to play a static strategy. They have played scissors multiple times in a row, resulting in a tie each time. This suggests that they may be consistently playing scissors. As a result, I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy, which is rock.

Summary:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing scissors, their likely play in the next round will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Top hypotheses: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.39313941, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.', 'value': 0.2829963, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 32: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 18: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.1601642851409319, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent has been consistently playing paper for the majority of the rounds. This is evident from the fact that in rounds 0, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 21, 22, 27, 28, 31, and 34, my opponent played paper. Additionally, the hypothesis with the highest value (0.39313941) also suggests that my opponent is likely to play paper.

Given this consistent pattern, it is likely that my opponent is following a static strategy of always playing paper. This would explain the negative rewards I've received when playing rock, as paper beats rock.

Therefore, my hypothesis is:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing paper, it is likely that they will continue to play paper in the next round, regardless of your previous play.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of paper in the next round, your next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.575197587, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.', 'value': 0.49809740999999996, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 32: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.4659, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 18: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.4121149995986523, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 35: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always choosing paper. This is supported by the fact that in the last 5 rounds, they have consistently played paper. Additionally, I have been consistently receiving positive rewards when playing scissors, which indicates that my opponent's static strategy can be exploited by playing the counter strategy of rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing paper, it is likely that they will continue to play paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, you should play scissors in the next round to counter their play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.15882941162999997, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.10263831090000008, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.', 'value': 0.048668186999999974, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 32: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.026129999999999987, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history. 
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between. 
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm. 
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice? 
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock. 
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent's strategy is not fixed and may be evolving. However, there are indications that they have a tendency to play paper more often than other choices. This is supported by the fact that I have received positive rewards when playing scissors, indicating that my opponent may have a tendency to play rock or scissors more often.

Given the history, it's likely that my opponent's policy is biased towards playing paper, but not exclusively. They may be playing a mixed strategy, with a higher probability of choosing paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is biased towards playing paper, but also has a tendency to play other choices.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the history of the opponent's plays and the fact that they have a tendency to play paper, it is likely that they will play paper again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, you should play scissors to counter their paper play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent has a tendency to play paper more often than other choices. This is supported by the fact that in the last 5 rounds, they played paper 4 times. Additionally, in the previous hypotheses, the likelihood of my opponent playing paper was consistently high.

Given this, I hypothesize that my opponent is biased towards playing paper, but also has a tendency to play other choices. This is supported by the data observed so far.

I am getting positive rewards when playing scissors, as it has been the most successful choice against my opponent's likely strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is biased towards playing paper, but also has a tendency to play other choices.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's bias towards playing paper and the fact that they played paper in the last round, it is likely that they will continue with paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors to beat their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {18: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.29193634980333966, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not playing a static strategy. The plays seem to be varied and do not indicate a consistent pattern that I can exploit. Additionally, the rewards for playing the same choice have been both positive and negative, indicating that there is no clear dominant strategy for my opponent.

Given this, I hypothesize that my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, where they randomly choose between rock, paper, and scissors without following a specific pattern. This mixed strategy makes it difficult to predict their next play with certainty.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, randomly choosing between rock, paper, and scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's mixed strategy, it is difficult to predict their next play. However, based on the history, there is an equal chance for them to play rock, paper, or scissors in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Since the opponent's play is unpredictable, I should continue to play based on my own mixed strategy to maintain balance. Therefore, I will continue to play rock, paper, and scissors with equal probability.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {18: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.5043554448623377, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.', 'value': 0.253693188141, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history. 
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between. 
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm. 
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice? 
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock. 
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy. 
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {18: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.5043554448623377, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.', 'value': 0.253693188141, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is playing a static strategy, always choosing paper. This is supported by the fact that whenever I play rock, I receive a negative reward, indicating that my opponent consistently beats me with paper.

Therefore, my hypothesis is:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing paper and the fact that your last play was rock, it is likely that the opponent will continue to play paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of paper in the next round, your next play should be scissors to counter their paper play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is likely to be playing a static policy. They have consistently played paper in the majority of the rounds, and I have consistently received positive rewards when playing scissors. This suggests that my opponent may be favoring paper as their choice.

Given this, my hypothesis is that my opponent is likely to be playing a static strategy of always choosing paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing paper, their likely play in the next round will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, your next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {18: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.15713416798254548, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.', 'value': 0.03430966218909004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution. This is supported by the fact that the opponent has played different moves in response to my plays, and there is no clear pattern indicating a static strategy.

The previous hypotheses about the opponent's strategy have not provided a strong explanation for the data observed so far. The opponent's plays seem to be distributed across rock, paper, and scissors without a clear bias towards any specific move.

Given this information, it's likely that the opponent is playing a mixed strategy, making their moves randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the history of the opponent's plays and the fact that they are likely playing a mixed strategy, it is difficult to predict their next play with certainty. However, based on the previous plays, there is a possibility that they might choose 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering the potential play of the opponent, it would be strategic to choose 'paper' as your next play to counter the possibility of their play being 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.', 'value': 0.32401676353236303, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 40: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 37: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is biased towards playing paper, but also has a tendency to play other choices.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history. 
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between. 
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm. 
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice? 
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock. 
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent's play is not biased towards a specific choice. The previous hypotheses suggest that my opponent may be playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution. The most recent interaction resulted in a tie, indicating that my opponent's play is not consistently countering mine.

Given the lack of a clear pattern and the mixed nature of the opponent's strategy, it is reasonable to assume that my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the history of the opponent's plays and the fact that their strategy appears to be a mixed strategy, it is difficult to predict their next play with certainty. However, based on the previous plays and the lack of a clear pattern, it is likely that the opponent's next play will be chosen randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the uncertainty in the opponent's strategy, it would be best to continue playing with a mixed strategy as well. This means continuing to choose your plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution to counter the uncertainty in the opponent's strategy.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {43: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history. 
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between. 
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm. 
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice? 
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock. 
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy. 
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

                }
                ```
                
                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {43: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution. This is indicated by the fact that their plays seem to be distributed across rock, paper, and scissors without a clear pattern. Additionally, my opponent's likely policy seems to be random or probabilistic, as indicated by the previous hypothesis.

Given this, I will continue to play based on my own mixed strategy, ensuring that I don't fall into predictable patterns that my opponent could exploit.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's mixed strategy, it's difficult to predict their next play with certainty. However, based on the history, it seems that they have played rock twice in a row. So, there might be a higher probability of them playing scissors or paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering the opponent's potential plays, it would be strategic to play scissors in the next round. This would cover both potential plays by the opponent.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 6, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 7, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 9, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 10, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 11, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 12, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 13, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 14, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 15, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 16, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 17, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 18, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 19, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 20, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 21, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 22, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 23, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 24, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 25, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 26, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 27, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 28, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 29, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 30, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 31, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 32, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 33, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 34, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 35, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 36, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 37, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 38, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 39, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 40, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 41, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 42, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 43, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 44, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}].
            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is biased towards playing paper, but also has a tendency to play other choices.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is playing a mixed strategy, choosing their plays randomly or based on some probabilistic distribution.', 'value': 0.24876821413085792, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 40: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 37: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is biased towards playing paper, but also has a tendency to play other choices.', 'value': 0.19100369999999994, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent has a tendency to play paper. In fact, in the last 10 rounds, they have played paper 7 times. This suggests that my opponent may have a bias towards playing paper, but also has a tendency to play other choices. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that they have played rock and scissors as well, albeit less frequently.

Given this observation, it is likely that my opponent's policy is biased towards playing paper, but they may also play other choices. This suggests that my opponent's strategy may not be entirely random, but rather influenced by a bias towards paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is biased towards playing paper, but also has a tendency to play other choices.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's bias towards playing paper and their recent play of paper, it is likely that they will continue with paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors to beat their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```
