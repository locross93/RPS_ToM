            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 1, {'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}].
            You last played: rock

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and since they played 'paper' last round, they are likely to play 'scissors' next to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would lose to their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'scissors', they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'scissors', their next play is likely to be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9753894278192201, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9753894278192201, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'scissors', their next likely play would be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9915585737419925, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9915585737419925, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'scissors', their next play is likely to be 'rock' to beat their previous 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely 'rock' play, my next move should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'paper' to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where both played 'rock', the opponent will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'rock', they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock'. To beat 'rock', they would play 'paper'. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to adapt their play based on the previous outcome and their last move. In the last round, the opponent won by playing 'rock' against my 'scissors'. According to their strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to their strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where both played 'rock', the opponent is likely to play 'rock' again. This is because the opponent's strategy suggests that after a tie where they played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the same move again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it and secure a win.

Since the last round was a tie with both playing 'paper', the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' next to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter their move effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' next to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter would be to play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they tend to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of 'scissors', my best move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9465160164044373, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9465160164044373, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper', which would be beaten by 'scissors'. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering that they played 'rock' in the last round, their next move is likely to be 'scissors' to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter it.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7573835881644002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering that they played 'paper' last round, their next play is likely to be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter and beat 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where both played the same move, the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'rock' next to beat their previous 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where the opponent played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (opponent played 'paper' and I played 'scissors'), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where both played 'rock', the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'rock', they might play 'paper' next to beat 'rock'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to adapt their play based on the outcome of the previous round. In the last round, I played scissors and won against their paper. According to their strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my previous move, they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock in the next round, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering that they played 'rock' in the last round, I predict their next play will be 'scissors' to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their move.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'paper', their next move is likely to be 'scissors' to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was paper, the opponent is likely to play scissors next to beat their own previous move of paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8164871887079244, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they tend to play the same move. In the last round, they won with scissors. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and won. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be 'scissors' again.

'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the same move after a win, the move that would beat their last move after a loss, and the move that would lose to their last move after a tie. In the last round, they won with scissors against my paper. According to their strategy, they are likely to play the same move again, which is scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8813624727193866, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'scissors', they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'rock', as rock beats scissors, which was their last move.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (paper in both rounds 205 and 206), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the predicted opponent's next play is scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter this.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the previous guess about the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat my last move. Since I played 'scissors' last, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' to beat it.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering they played 'rock' in the last round, their next play is likely to be 'paper' to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'rock', they are likely to play 'paper' next to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9478113495597834, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering they played 'scissors' last round, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last round move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, it is likely that the opponent will play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round, my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'scissors', they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'scissors', their next likely play would be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7230466301670595, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and given that they played 'rock' in the last round, their next likely play would be 'paper' to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors vs rock), they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper to ensure a win.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (both rounds 284 and 285 were 'paper'), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter this.

1.

'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors against my rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter would be to play paper.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a win. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to their strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (paper), they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played paper last, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```
