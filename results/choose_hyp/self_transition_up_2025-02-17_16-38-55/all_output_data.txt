User Message: 


            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 1, {'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}].
            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.0}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move, and their last move was scissors, I predict their next play will be rock to beat scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```
