1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given my previous guess about the opponent's strategy, where they play the move that would beat their last round's move, the opponent played 'rock' in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper' to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock', which would lose to 'paper'. Therefore, it is likely that they will play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter this and win the round.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (scissors), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter this.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (rock beats scissors), they are likely to play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and considering that I played 'paper' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' in the next round to beat my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the same move as their opponent's last move, and considering that I played 'rock' in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

1.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors vs. rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move. Therefore, their next play is predicted to be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper to secure a win.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat my last move, and since I played 'rock' last, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat my last move. Since I played scissors last, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

1.

In the last round, they played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' next, as it beats 'paper'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to adapt their next move based on the previous outcomes and transitions. In the last round, the opponent played scissors and won against my paper. According to their strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would lose to their last round's move, and given that they played 'rock' in the last round, their next move is likely to be 'scissors', as 'scissors' would lose to 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock', as 'rock' beats 'scissors'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (paper against scissors), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the same move again. In the last round, they played 'scissors', which beat my 'paper' from two rounds ago. Therefore, it's likely they will play 'scissors' again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as it beats 'scissors'.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, both of us played 'rock', resulting in a tie. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best move to counter this would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie in which the opponent played the same move in the last round as the opponent played two rounds ago, the opponent plays the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, both the opponent and I played scissors, which was the same move as two rounds ago. Therefore, according to the strategy, the opponent is likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round', 'value': -0.3440980267396138, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. According to their strategy, after a win, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
