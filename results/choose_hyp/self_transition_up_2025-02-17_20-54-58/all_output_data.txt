1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played 'rock' and won against the opponent's 'scissors'. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play 'scissors' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move in the last round as they did two rounds ago (both were 'rock'), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict the opponent will play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they tend to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors, which means they might play rock next to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'rock', the opponent is likely to play 'rock' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'scissors', I predict their next play will be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

In the last round, I played paper and won against their rock.

Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play paper in the next round, my best counter-move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', I should play 'paper' to counter it and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the same move as their opponent's last move. In the last round, I played 'paper', so it is likely that the opponent will play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock'. To beat 'rock', they would play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8476168259051741, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper'.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'paper', they are likely to play 'scissors' next to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to adapt their play based on the previous outcomes and transitions. In the last round, I played 'paper' and won against their 'rock'. According to their strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my previous move, they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper' in the next round, my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, after a loss where the opponent played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (opponent played paper, I played scissors), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round ended in a tie with both playing rock, I predict that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (they played rock, which beats scissors), they tend to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by my opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'rock', their next play is likely to be 'paper' to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'scissors', their likely next play would be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1.

In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, after a loss, they would play the move that beats their last move, which is 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors' to ensure a win.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. After a loss the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move. After a tie the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8445349884290797, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper and lost. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors next to beat their previous move of paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

  'my_next_play': 'rock'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7658453469767321, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'scissors', they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors'. To beat 'scissors', they would likely play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'paper', it is likely that they will play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they tend to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where both played rock, the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played rock last, they might play paper next to beat rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (paper beats rock), they are likely to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering that they played 'rock' in the last round, their next move is likely to be 'paper' to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where both players played the same move (paper), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played scissors (which would lose to my previous play of rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, they might play rock in the next round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they tend to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering that they played 'paper' in the last round, their next play is likely to be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'rock', their next likely play is 'paper' to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering that they played 'paper' in the last round, their next move is likely to be 'rock' to beat 'scissors', which would have beaten their last move.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'scissors', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, the opponent played scissors and won. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where both played the same move (paper), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next, my best counter-move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost to my rock. Therefore, they are likely to play rock next to beat their previous move, scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter their rock and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' next to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played rock against my paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played rock last round, they are likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

1.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' next to beat their previous 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper' to beat their 'rock'.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played paper against my scissors), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper to beat their rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago, they will play the move that beats their last move. In the last round, the opponent played scissors, which is the same move they played two rounds ago. According to their strategy, they will play the move that beats scissors, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter is to play paper, as paper beats rock.

1.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'paper' to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their 'paper'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering that they played 'paper' in the last round, their next likely play would be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter and beat 'rock'.

1.

Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play paper next, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

1.

Since they played paper last round, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors against rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move is paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss in which the opponent played the move in the last round that would beat the opponent's move two rounds ago, the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round, my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors against rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' next to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (rock against paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played rock last round, they are likely to play paper next.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and since they played 'scissors' last round, their likely next play is 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.5258044388614633, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'scissors', they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to beat 'rock'.

```python
{
