1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they lost the last round where they played scissors against my paper. According to the strategy, after a loss where the opponent played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors beats paper), they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors vs. rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter it.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper' to secure a win.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (they played paper against my rock, which would beat my scissors from two rounds ago), they are likely to play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to their strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors'. Therefore, to beat 'scissors', they would likely play 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'scissors', their next likely play would be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9657452741570067, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'scissors', I predict their next play will be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper', which would lose to 'scissors'. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter would be to play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, where they tend to play the move that would beat my last move, and considering my last play was 'rock', the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat my 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (both were 'paper'), the opponent is likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since their last move was 'paper', they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock' to win the round.

In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors' to ensure a win.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (opponent played paper against my scissors), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter this.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next to beat their last move, 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would beat my last move (scissors beats paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

1.

1.

According to their strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they play the move that would beat their last round's move.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next to beat their last move, 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played scissors (which beats my previous play of paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that beats their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to their strategy, they should play 'paper' next to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors against rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. Therefore, according to their pattern, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to adapt their play based on the previous outcome and their own last move. In the last round, they won by playing scissors against my paper. According to the strategy, after a win where they played the move that would beat my last move, they will play the move that would beat their last move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter-move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (rock vs paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move. Since they played rock last, they are likely to play paper next.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors against rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (opponent played rock, I played paper, and two rounds ago I played rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter is to play scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. Therefore, they are likely to play 'scissors' next to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock' to beat their 'scissors'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors against rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

1.

In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (scissors), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper'. To beat 'paper', they would play 'scissors'. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'scissors', they are likely to play 'rock' next to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since both of us played 'scissors' in the last round, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors vs. rock), they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'scissors', their next move is likely to be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played scissors against my rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my best counter-move would be paper to ensure a win.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played paper against my scissors), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper to ensure a win.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played paper against my scissors), they are likely to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Therefore, their next play is predicted to be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's next play is predicted to be rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'rock', they are likely to play 'paper' next to beat their own 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'paper', it is likely that they will play 'scissors' next to beat 'paper'.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9745862976608931, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'paper', their next move is likely to be 'scissors' to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (they played paper against my rock), they are likely to play the same move again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous guess about the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper', which would beat 'rock'. Therefore, I predict their next move will be 'scissors' to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8785329706334182, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'paper', their likely next play is 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (rock vs. scissors), they tend to play the move that would beat their last move. In the last round, they played paper, which would beat rock. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper'), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago (scissors vs. paper), they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played paper, which loses to my rock from two rounds ago), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy and the last interaction, where I played 'rock' and they played 'scissors', resulting in my win, the opponent's strategy suggests that after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they will play the move that would beat their last round's move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'paper' next, as it beats their last move 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the same move again. In the last round, they played scissors, which beat my paper from two rounds ago. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my best counter-move is to play rock, which beats scissors.

1.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they play the move that would lose to their last round's move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing 'paper', the opponent is likely to play 'rock' next, as 'rock' loses to 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it, as 'paper' beats 'rock'.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'rock', they are likely to play 'paper' next to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.8005857386625043, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'scissors' to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'scissors', I predict their next play will be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they tend to play the same move as they did in the last round. Since they won the last round with scissors, it is likely that they will play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7143918352484376, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and given that they played 'rock' in the last round, they are likely to play 'paper' in the next round to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (they played rock against my paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of paper, my best move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, they played paper, which would lose to my scissors from two rounds ago. Therefore, they are likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, I should play rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors vs. rock), they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played scissors last round, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'rock' next, as it beats 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move after a loss where they played the move that would lose to my move two rounds ago. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to their strategy, they will likely play 'paper' next to beat their previous 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie where the opponent played the same move as two rounds ago (paper), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. Therefore, I predict their next move will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played the move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the same move again. In the last round, they played 'scissors' which beat my 'paper' from two rounds ago. Therefore, it's likely they will play 'scissors' again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'rock', their next play is likely to be 'rock' again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'rock' next, as it would beat their last move 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering they played 'scissors' in the last round, I predict their next play will be 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter 'rock'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would lose to their last round's move. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock', which would lose to 'paper' (my move two rounds ago). Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to play 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would beat my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the same move again. In round 261, they played 'paper' which beat my 'rock' from round 260. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

1.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy and the last action I played (paper), the opponent lost the last round. According to the strategy, after a loss where the opponent played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (rock vs paper), they will play the move that beats their last move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. Therefore, they are likely to play 'rock' next to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (scissors vs. rock), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last move. Since they played scissors last, they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

1.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago, they tend to play the move that would beat their last round's move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to their strategy, they are likely to play 'rock' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper' to ensure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss where they played a move that would lose to my move two rounds ago (opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper'), they are likely to play the move that would beat their last round's move. Since they played 'rock' last, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they play the same move as they did in the last round. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last move was 'rock', their next likely play would be 'paper' to beat 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter 'paper'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering that they played 'paper' in the last round, their next move is likely to be 'scissors' to beat 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their move.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.9560289029448781, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and considering their last play was 'paper', their likely play in the next round is 'scissors' to beat their previous 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7905787910817934, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move', 'value': 0.7905787910817934, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that would beat their last round's move, and given that they played 'scissors' in the last round, their next play is likely to be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', my next play should be 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```
