Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, we have the following information:

1. In round 0, I played 'scissors' and my opponent played 'paper'. I received a reward of 3, indicating that I won this round.

Given that this is the only round of data we have, it's difficult to determine a concrete strategy for the opponent. However, we can make some initial observations and hypotheses:

- The opponent played 'paper' in the first round. This could be a random choice, or it could be part of a static or more complex strategy.
- Since I won by playing 'scissors', if the opponent is playing a static strategy of always choosing 'paper', I could continue to exploit this by consistently playing 'scissors'.
- Alternatively, if the opponent is adapting to my moves, they might choose 'rock' in the next round to counter my 'scissors'.

Given the limited data, my initial hypothesis is that the opponent might be playing a static strategy, but this is highly uncertain. I will need more rounds of data to refine this hypothesis.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent played paper in the first round. It is unclear if this is a static strategy or part of a more complex pattern. Further data is needed to refine this hypothesis.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent played paper in the first round, it is possible they might continue with paper if they have a static strategy. However, without more data, it's also possible they could switch to rock or scissors. Assuming they might continue with paper for now, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play paper, my best counter move would be to play scissors to win against paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper'. I won and received a reward of 3.
2. **Round 1**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. It was a tie, and I received a reward of 0.

From these two rounds, we can make the following observations:

- In Round 0, the opponent played 'paper', which lost to my 'scissors'.
- In Round 1, the opponent played 'scissors', which tied with my 'scissors'.

Given this limited data, it's difficult to definitively determine the opponent's strategy. However, we can hypothesize a few possibilities:

1. **Random Strategy**: The opponent might be playing randomly, as there is no clear pattern in their moves.
2. **Static Strategy**: The opponent might have a static strategy where they play a fixed sequence of moves or a single move repeatedly. However, with only two rounds, it's hard to confirm this.
3. **Reactive Strategy**: The opponent might be reacting to my previous move. For instance, after losing with 'paper', they switched to 'scissors', which could be an attempt to counter my 'scissors'.

Given the current data, the most straightforward hypothesis is that the opponent might be playing randomly or has a simple reactive strategy. However, more rounds are needed to confirm this.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent might be playing randomly or has a simple reactive strategy, switching moves after a loss.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent might switch moves after a loss and they played scissors last round, they might switch to rock in the next round to counter my previous play of scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper'. I won, receiving a reward of 3.
2. **Round 1**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. It was a tie, so I received a reward of 0.
3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper'. It was another tie, so I received a reward of 0.

From this, we can observe the following:

- The opponent played 'paper' in round 0 and 'scissors' in round 1, then 'paper' again in round 2. 
- There is no clear pattern of the opponent switching moves based on the outcome of the previous round (win, lose, or tie).

Given the limited data, one hypothesis could be that the opponent is playing randomly or has a static strategy that doesn't depend on the previous round's outcome. However, the repetition of 'paper' in rounds 0 and 2 might suggest a slight preference or pattern, but it's too early to confirm.

Since I received a positive reward when I played 'scissors' in round 0, it might be beneficial to continue playing 'scissors' to see if the opponent continues to play 'paper' more frequently.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent may be playing randomly or has a slight preference for paper, given the limited data. Continue testing by playing scissors to exploit potential paper preference.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the limited data, the opponent has shown a preference for paper in 2 out of 3 rounds. It is possible they may continue with paper, but they might also switch to rock to counter my previous play of scissors. However, given the slight preference for paper, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my best move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent might be playing randomly or has a simple reactive strategy, switching moves after a loss.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history:

1. Round 0: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
2. Round 1: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. It was a tie.
3. Round 2: I played paper, opponent played paper. It was a tie.
4. Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.

From this data, let's consider the opponent's possible strategy:

- In Round 0, the opponent played paper, which lost to my scissors.
- In Round 1, the opponent played scissors, which tied with my scissors. This suggests they might have switched from paper to scissors after losing.
- In Round 2, the opponent played paper again, which tied with my paper. This could indicate a pattern of alternating between paper and scissors.
- In Round 3, the opponent played rock, which beat my scissors. This suggests they might have switched to rock after tying with paper.

Given this pattern, the opponent seems to be alternating between moves, possibly in a cycle of paper -> scissors -> rock. This could be a simple cyclic strategy.

To test this hypothesis, let's predict the opponent's next move based on this cycle. If they are following a paper -> scissors -> rock cycle, their next move should be paper.

To counter this, I should play scissors, which beats paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent appears to be following a cyclic strategy of paper -> scissors -> rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's cyclic strategy of paper -> scissors -> rock, and their last play being rock, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent might be playing randomly or has a simple reactive strategy, switching moves after a loss.', 'value': 0.363, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

Let's analyze the interaction history to understand the opponent's strategy:

1. **Round 0**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
2. **Round 1**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. It was a tie.
3. **Round 2**: I played paper, opponent played paper. It was a tie.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.
5. **Round 4**: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost again.

From the interaction history, we can observe the following patterns:

- After losing in Round 3 with scissors against rock, I played scissors again in Round 4 and lost again to rock. This suggests that the opponent might be sticking with rock after winning.
- The opponent played paper in Round 0 and then switched to scissors in Round 1, which resulted in a tie. This could indicate a random or reactive strategy, but it's not consistent enough to be certain.
- The opponent played paper in Round 2, resulting in a tie, and then switched to rock in Round 3, which won against my scissors.

Given these observations, the opponent might be playing a strategy where they stick with a winning move (rock in this case) after winning. This is supported by the fact that they played rock in both Rounds 3 and 4 after winning in Round 3.

To exploit this, I should play paper in the next round, as it beats rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent seems to stick with rock after winning with it. They might be using a strategy where they continue with a winning move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent has played rock after winning with it in the last two rounds, it is likely they will continue with rock as their next play.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

4. Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.
5. Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.
6. Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.

Observations:
- The opponent played paper in round 0 and then switched to scissors in round 1 after losing.
- After a tie in round 1, the opponent played paper again in round 2.
- After a tie in round 2, the opponent switched to rock in round 3.
- The opponent continued playing rock in round 4 after winning in round 3.
- After losing in round 5, the opponent might switch from rock.

Hypothesis:
- The opponent seems to switch moves after a loss, possibly cycling through rock, paper, and scissors.
- After a win, the opponent tends to stick with the winning move.
- After a tie, the opponent might switch to a different move, possibly cycling through the options.

Given this pattern, the opponent might switch from rock after losing in round 5. If they are cycling, they might play paper next.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches moves after a loss, possibly cycling through rock, paper, and scissors. After a win, they stick with the winning move. After a tie, they might switch to a different move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost. Based on the opponent's strategy of switching moves after a loss, they might switch to 'paper' or 'scissors'. Since they have not played 'scissors' in the last two rounds, they might choose 'scissors' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent might be playing randomly or has a simple reactive strategy, switching moves after a loss.', 'value': 0.08787000000000006, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history:

1. Round 0: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
2. Round 1: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
3. Round 2: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.
4. Round 3: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.
5. Round 4: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.
6. Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
7. Round 6: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.

From this history, we can observe the following patterns:

- After losing in round 3, the opponent repeated their move (rock) in round 4.
- After winning in round 4, the opponent repeated their move (rock) in round 5.
- After losing in round 5, the opponent switched to paper in round 6.

This suggests that the opponent might be following a strategy where they repeat their move after a win or tie, and switch after a loss. However, this is not entirely consistent, as they switched from paper to rock after a tie in round 2.

Given the limited data, a plausible hypothesis is that the opponent tends to repeat their move after a win or tie, but switches after a loss. This is a simple reactive strategy, but not perfectly consistent.

Regarding my rewards:
- I received positive rewards when playing scissors against paper (round 0) and paper against rock (round 5).
- I received negative rewards when playing scissors against rock (rounds 3 and 4) and rock against paper (round 6).

Based on this analysis, my strategy should be to anticipate the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win or tie and switch after a loss. I should play the counter to their expected move based on this pattern.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win or tie, and switch after a loss. However, this pattern is not perfectly consistent.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win or tie, and switching after a loss, and given that they won the last round with 'paper', it is likely that they will repeat 'paper' in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Round 0**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
2. **Round 1**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
3. **Round 2**: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.
5. **Round 4**: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.
6. **Round 5**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
7. **Round 6**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
8. **Round 7**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.

From the interaction history, we can observe the following patterns:

- The opponent played paper in rounds 0, 1, 2, 6, and 7.
- The opponent played rock in rounds 3, 4, and 5.
- The opponent seems to switch moves after a loss (e.g., from rock to paper after losing in round 5).
- After a win or tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the move (e.g., paper in rounds 0 and 1, rock in rounds 3 and 4).

Based on these observations, the opponent might be using a strategy where they tend to repeat a move after a win or tie but switch after a loss. This pattern is not perfectly consistent, but it appears frequently enough to be a potential strategy.

Regarding my plays:
- I have had success with scissors against paper (rounds 0 and 7).
- I lost with scissors against rock (rounds 3 and 4).
- I won with paper against rock (round 5).
- I lost with rock against paper (round 6).

Given these insights, the opponent might have a slight preference for paper, as it appears more frequently. Playing scissors could exploit this tendency, especially if they continue to play paper after a win or tie.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win or tie, and switch after a loss. They show a slight preference for paper, which can be exploited by playing scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win or tie. In the last round, they played paper and lost. According to their strategy, they are likely to switch their move. Given their slight preference for paper, they might switch to rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
2. **Round 1**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
3. **Round 2**: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.
5. **Round 4**: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.
6. **Round 5**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
7. **Round 6**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
8. **Round 7**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
9. **Round 8**: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.

Observations:
- The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) three times in total.
- The opponent's choice does not seem to directly depend on my last move, as there is no clear pattern of countering my previous move.
- The opponent's choices appear somewhat random, but they might be following a pattern that is not immediately obvious.

Hypothesis:
- The opponent might be cycling through rock, paper, and scissors in a non-obvious order or using a random strategy.
- There is no consistent pattern of the opponent adapting to my moves or repeating a specific move after a win, loss, or tie.

Given the lack of a clear pattern, the opponent might be using a random strategy or a complex cycle that is not yet apparent. I will continue to monitor for any emerging patterns.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent appears to be using a random strategy or a non-obvious cycle of rock, paper, and scissors. No clear adaptation to my moves is observed yet.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's previous plays, there is no clear pattern or adaptation to my moves. They have played each option multiple times, suggesting a random or non-obvious cycle. After playing scissors last, they might switch to rock, as they have done in previous rounds after playing scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the possibility of the opponent playing rock, my best move would be paper, as it beats rock.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and the hypotheses:

1. **Round 0**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
2. **Round 1**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
3. **Round 2**: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.
5. **Round 4**: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.
6. **Round 5**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
7. **Round 6**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
8. **Round 7**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
9. **Round 8**: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.
10. **Round 9**: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.

From this history, we can observe the following patterns:

- After winning with a move, the opponent tends to repeat it (e.g., rock in rounds 3 and 4).
- After losing, the opponent switches moves (e.g., from rock in round 5 to paper in round 6).
- After a tie, the opponent may switch moves (e.g., from paper in round 2 to rock in round 3).

The opponent seems to have a tendency to repeat a winning move and switch after a loss. This pattern is not perfectly consistent, but it is a reasonable hypothesis based on the observed data.

Regarding my rewards:
- I have received positive rewards when playing scissors against paper (rounds 0 and 7).
- I have received negative rewards when playing paper against scissors (rounds 8 and 9).

Given these observations, the opponent might be using a strategy where they repeat a winning move and switch after a loss, with a slight preference for paper. This can be exploited by playing scissors more frequently.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss. They show a slight preference for paper, which can be exploited by playing scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. In the last two rounds, they played scissors and won both times. Therefore, it is likely that they will play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their plays and our corresponding rewards:

1. **Rounds 0-1**: Opponent played paper and then scissors. We won the first round with scissors against paper and tied the second round with scissors against scissors.
2. **Rounds 2-3**: Opponent played paper twice. We tied the first round with paper against paper and lost the second round with scissors against rock.
3. **Rounds 4-5**: Opponent played rock twice. We lost the first round with scissors against rock and won the second round with paper against rock.
4. **Rounds 6-7**: Opponent played paper and then scissors. We lost the first round with rock against paper and won the second round with scissors against paper.
5. **Rounds 8-9**: Opponent played scissors twice. We lost both rounds with paper against scissors.
6. **Round 10**: Opponent played scissors. We won with rock against scissors.

From this analysis, we can observe the following patterns:

- The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win (e.g., rounds 2-3, 4-5, 8-9).
- The opponent switches moves after a loss (e.g., rounds 0-1, 6-7).
- There is a slight preference for paper, as seen in rounds 0, 2, 6.

Given these observations, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows: they tend to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss. They show a slight preference for paper, which can be exploited by playing scissors. However, since they have played scissors in the last three rounds, they might switch to another move in the next round.

Based on this hypothesis, we should consider playing rock, as it counters both scissors and a potential switch to paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss. They show a slight preference for paper, which can be exploited by playing scissors. However, they might switch moves after consecutive plays of the same move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played scissors and lost. Based on the strategy guess that they tend to switch after a loss, it is likely they will change their move. They have shown a slight preference for paper, so they might switch to paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': If the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors to exploit their preference and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {7: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win or tie, and switch after a loss. However, this pattern is not perfectly consistent.', 'value': 0.62613, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 5: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent seems to stick with rock after winning with it. They might be using a strategy where they continue with a winning move.', 'value': 0.6110036999999999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches moves after a loss, possibly cycling through rock, paper, and scissors.

After a tie, they might switch to a different move.', 'value': 0.575709, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Round 0**: Opponent played paper, I played scissors, I won.
2. **Round 1**: Opponent played scissors, I played scissors, tie.
3. **Round 2**: Opponent played paper, I played paper, tie.
4. **Round 3**: Opponent played rock, I played scissors, I lost.
5. **Round 4**: Opponent played rock, I played scissors, I lost.
6. **Round 5**: Opponent played rock, I played paper, I won.
7. **Round 6**: Opponent played paper, I played rock, I lost.
8. **Round 7**: Opponent played paper, I played scissors, I won.
9. **Round 8**: Opponent played scissors, I played paper, I lost.
10. **Round 9**: Opponent played scissors, I played paper, I lost.
11. **Round 10**: Opponent played scissors, I played rock, I won.
12. **Round 11**: Opponent played rock, I played scissors, I lost.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win or tie, as seen in rounds 1-2 and 3-4.
- After a loss, the opponent tends to switch moves, as seen in rounds 5-6 and 7-8.
- The opponent has a tendency to play rock after winning with it, as seen in rounds 3-4.
- The opponent's strategy is not perfectly consistent, but there is a noticeable pattern of repeating moves after a win or tie and switching after a loss.

**Hypothesis refinement:**

The opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:
- After a win or tie, the opponent tends to repeat their move.
- After a loss, the opponent switches moves, possibly cycling through rock, paper, and scissors.
- The opponent seems to favor rock after winning with it.

Based on this analysis, my strategy should be to anticipate the opponent's next move based on their previous outcome and counter it accordingly.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win or tie, and switch after a loss. They favor rock after winning with it.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. In the last round, they won with rock. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be rock again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.

                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Opponent played paper, I played scissors, I won.
2. **Round 1**: Opponent played scissors, I played scissors, tie.
3. **Round 2**: Opponent played paper, I played paper, tie.
4. **Round 3**: Opponent played rock, I played scissors, I lost.
5. **Round 4**: Opponent played rock, I played scissors, I lost.
6. **Round 5**: Opponent played rock, I played paper, I won.
7. **Round 6**: Opponent played paper, I played rock, I lost.
8. **Round 7**: Opponent played paper, I played scissors, I won.
9. **Round 8**: Opponent played scissors, I played paper, I lost.
10. **Round 9**: Opponent played scissors, I played paper, I lost.
11. **Round 10**: Opponent played scissors, I played rock, I won.
12. **Round 11**: Opponent played rock, I played scissors, I lost.
13. **Round 12**: Opponent played rock, I played paper, I won.
14. **Round 13**: Opponent played paper, I played scissors, I won.
15. **Round 14**: Opponent played scissors, I played paper, I lost.

**Step-by-step Analysis:**

- The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win or tie, as seen in rounds 1-2 and 8-9.
- After a loss, the opponent tends to switch their move, as seen in rounds 3-4 and 11-12.
- The opponent's pattern is not perfectly consistent, but there is a tendency to repeat moves after non-loss outcomes and switch after losses.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**

The previous hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win or tie and switches after a loss still holds, but with some inconsistencies. The opponent's strategy might be a simple pattern recognition or a static strategy with occasional randomization.

**Reward Analysis:**

- Positive rewards are obtained when I play scissors against paper and rock against scissors.
- Negative rewards are obtained when I play paper against scissors and rock against paper.

**Conclusion:**

The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating moves after non-loss outcomes and switching after losses, with some inconsistencies. This suggests a semi-static strategy with occasional deviations.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played scissors and won. Based on the observed pattern that the opponent tends to repeat their move after a win, it is likely that they will play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins and Ties**: 
   - Round 0: Opponent played 'paper' and lost, switched to 'scissors' in round 1.
   - Round 1: Opponent played 'scissors' and tied, repeated 'scissors' in round 2.
   - Round 2: Opponent played 'paper' and tied, repeated 'paper' in round 3.
   - Round 5: Opponent played 'rock' and lost, switched to 'paper' in round 6.
   - Round 6: Opponent played 'paper' and won, repeated 'paper' in round 7.
   - Round 7: Opponent played 'paper' and lost, switched to 'scissors' in round 8.
   - Round 8: Opponent played 'scissors' and won, repeated 'scissors' in round 9.
   - Round 9: Opponent played 'scissors' and won, repeated 'scissors' in round 10.
   - Round 10: Opponent played 'scissors' and lost, switched to 'rock' in round 11.
   - Round 11: Opponent played 'rock' and won, repeated 'rock' in round 12.
   - Round 12: Opponent played 'rock' and lost, switched to 'paper' in round 13.
   - Round 13: Opponent played 'paper' and lost, switched to 'scissors' in round 14.
   - Round 14: Opponent played 'scissors' and won, repeated 'scissors' in round 15.

2. **Losses**:
   - After losing, the opponent tends to switch their move. For example, after losing with 'rock' in round 5, they switched to 'paper' in round 6.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent often repeats their move after a win or tie, and switches after a loss. This pattern is not perfectly consistent, but it is a noticeable trend.

4. **Static Strategy**:
   - The opponent does not seem to be playing a static strategy, as they switch moves after losses and sometimes repeat after wins or ties.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play 'rock', I have received positive rewards in rounds 10 and 15. This suggests that the opponent might be playing 'scissors' more frequently, which I can exploit by playing 'rock'.

Given this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win or tie, and switch after a loss. They show a tendency to play scissors more frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win or tie and switching after a loss, and considering their tendency to play scissors more frequently, it is likely that they will switch from scissors to rock in the next round after losing the last round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins and Repeats**: The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win. For example:
   - Round 0: Opponent played paper and lost, switched to rock in round 1.
   - Round 5: Opponent played rock and lost, switched to paper in round 6.
   - Round 10: Opponent played scissors and lost, switched to rock in round 11.

2. **Losses and Switching**: The opponent switches moves after a loss. This is evident in several rounds:
   - Round 3: Opponent played rock and won, repeated rock in round 4.
   - Round 6: Opponent played paper and lost, switched to scissors in round 7.
   - Round 11: Opponent played rock and won, repeated rock in round 12.

3. **Ties and Inconsistency**: The opponent's behavior after ties is less predictable, but they sometimes switch:
   - Round 1: Opponent played scissors and tied, switched to paper in round 2.
   - Round 2: Opponent played paper and tied, switched to rock in round 3.

4. **Frequent Scissors**: The opponent shows a tendency to play scissors more frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.

5. **Static Strategy**: The opponent may not be adapting to my strategy but rather following a pattern of switching after losses and repeating after wins.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows: they tend to repeat their move after a win or tie and switch after a loss. They also show a tendency to play scissors more frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win or tie, and switch after a loss. They show a tendency to play scissors more frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win or tie and switching after a loss, and given that they lost the last round (they played rock and I played paper), they are likely to switch from rock. Considering their tendency to play scissors more frequently, it is likely they will switch to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.

                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent tends to switch moves after a loss. For example, after losing with paper against my scissors in round 0, they switched to scissors in round 1.
   - After a win, they tend to repeat the winning move. For instance, after winning with rock against my scissors in round 3, they played rock again in round 4.
   - After a tie, they might switch to a different move, but this is less consistent.

2. **Static Strategy or Adaptive**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be somewhat adaptive, as they switch moves after a loss and repeat after a win. However, this pattern is not perfectly consistent, indicating they might not be a highly adaptive agent but rather following a simple rule-based strategy.

3. **Positive and Negative Rewards**:
   - I have received positive rewards when playing scissors against their paper and rock against their scissors.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play paper against their scissors or rock against their paper.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern where they switch moves after a loss and repeat after a win. This aligns with the previous hypotheses, particularly the one stating they tend to repeat after a win or tie and switch after a loss.

Based on this analysis, the opponent likely follows a strategy where they repeat a winning move and switch after a loss. This strategy can be exploited by anticipating their next move based on their last outcome.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss. After a tie, they might switch to a different move, but this is less consistent.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played scissors and won. According to the guessed strategy, the opponent tends to repeat their move after a win. Therefore, I predict that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

After a tie, they might switch to a different move, but this is less consistent.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat the winning move. For example:
   - Round 3: Opponent wins with rock, plays rock again in round 4.
   - Round 8: Opponent wins with scissors, plays scissors again in round 9.

2. **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they tend to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 0: Opponent loses with paper, switches to scissors in round 1.
   - Round 5: Opponent loses with rock, switches to paper in round 6.

3. **Ties**: After a tie, the opponent's behavior is less consistent, but they often switch moves. For example:
   - Round 1: Tie with scissors, switches to paper in round 2.
   - Round 2: Tie with paper, switches to rock in round 3.

Overall, the opponent seems to follow a pattern where they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and often switch after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent, but it provides a general guideline for predicting their behavior.

Given this analysis, my strategy should focus on exploiting the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win and switch after a loss. Since they often switch after a tie, I should be cautious in predicting their next move in such cases.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss. After a tie, they often switch to a different move, but this is less consistent.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played scissors and lost. Based on their strategy of switching after a loss, they are likely to switch to a different move. Since they lost with scissors, they might switch to rock or paper. Given their tendency to switch after a loss, I predict they might play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Observation of Patterns:**
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win or tie, and switch after a loss. This pattern has been observed consistently in several hypotheses.
   - The opponent seems to favor rock after winning with it, as noted in hypothesis 12.
   - There is a tendency for the opponent to switch moves after a loss, possibly cycling through rock, paper, and scissors.

2. **Analysis of Recent Rounds:**
   - In round 20, the opponent played scissors and lost to my rock. In round 21, they switched to rock, which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch after a loss.
   - In round 21, the opponent played rock and lost to my paper. Based on the pattern, they might switch to another move in the next round.

3. **Evaluation of Hypotheses:**
   - The hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win or tie and switches after a loss seems to explain the data well. The opponent's tendency to favor rock after winning with it is also consistent with their behavior.
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be somewhat predictable, allowing for exploitation by anticipating their next move based on their previous outcome.

4. **Strategy Moving Forward:**
   - Given the opponent's tendency to switch after a loss, it is likely they will not play rock again in the next round. They might switch to paper or scissors.
   - To counter this, I should consider playing scissors, as it would beat paper and tie with scissors.

In summary, the opponent's strategy can be described as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win or tie, and switch after a loss. They favor rock after winning with it. After a loss, they might switch to a different move, possibly cycling through rock, paper, and scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent played 'rock' in the last round and lost. Based on the strategy that they tend to switch after a loss, they might switch to 'paper' or 'scissors'. Given their tendency to cycle through moves, they are likely to play 'paper' next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, I should play 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Top hypotheses: {7: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win or tie, and switch after a loss.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they seem to repeat their winning move. For example:
   - Round 0: Opponent plays paper and loses to scissors. Next round, they play scissors.
   - Round 3: Opponent plays rock and wins against scissors. Next round, they play rock again.
   - Round 6: Opponent plays paper and wins against rock. Next round, they play paper again.

2. **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they tend to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 5: Opponent plays rock and loses to paper. Next round, they switch to paper.
   - Round 10: Opponent plays scissors and loses to rock. Next round, they switch to rock.

3. **Ties**: When the opponent ties, they seem to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 1: Opponent plays scissors and ties. Next round, they switch to paper.
   - Round 2: Opponent plays paper and ties. Next round, they switch to rock.

From this analysis, it appears that the opponent follows a pattern where they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent, but it is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Given this hypothesis, I can exploit this by predicting their next move based on the outcome of the previous round. If they win, I should play the move that beats their last move. If they lose or tie, I should anticipate a switch and play accordingly.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. In the last round, they played paper and won. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be paper again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my best move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent has played each of the three moves (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - There is no clear pattern of repeating the same move consecutively for many rounds.

2. **Analyzing Wins and Losses**:
   - When I played scissors and won (rounds 0, 7, 13, 18, 22), the opponent played paper.
   - When I played paper and won (rounds 5, 12, 16, 21, 24), the opponent played rock.
   - When I played rock and won (rounds 10, 15, 20, 23), the opponent played scissors.

3. **Analyzing Ties**:
   - Ties occurred when both played the same move: scissors in round 1 and 26.

4. **Analyzing Losses**:
   - Losses occurred when the opponent played the move that beats mine:
     - When I played scissors and lost (rounds 3, 4, 11), the opponent played rock.
     - When I played paper and lost (rounds 8, 9, 14, 19), the opponent played scissors.
     - When I played rock and lost (rounds 6, 17, 25), the opponent played paper.

5. **Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent does not seem to follow a simple static strategy like always playing the same move.
   - The opponent's moves do not seem to be directly reactive to my last move.
   - There is a possibility that the opponent is playing randomly or using a complex pattern that is not immediately obvious from the data.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the mixed results and lack of a clear pattern, the opponent might be playing a random strategy or a complex pattern that is not easily discernible from the current data.
   - Since there is no clear advantage in playing any specific move repeatedly, a balanced approach or further observation is needed to refine the hypothesis.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent seems to play a mix of moves without a clear pattern. They might be playing randomly or using a complex strategy that is not immediately obvious. Further observation is needed to refine the hypothesis.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's mixed strategy with no clear pattern, it's challenging to predict their next move with certainty. However, considering the recent tie with scissors, the opponent might switch to a different move. Since they have played rock after scissors ties in the past, they might play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {11: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss. They show a slight preference for paper, which can be exploited by playing scissors. However, they might switch moves after consecutive plays of the same move.', 'value': 0.155709, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and look for patterns:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent has shown a preference for paper, as seen in rounds 0, 2, 7, 13, 18, 22, and 26.
   - They have played rock in rounds 3, 4, 5, 11, 12, 16, 21, and 24.
   - They have played scissors in rounds 1, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 23, and 25.

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - After winning with rock (rounds 5, 12, 16, 21, 24), they tend to switch to paper or scissors.
   - After losing with paper (rounds 0, 7, 13, 18, 22), they tend to switch to rock or scissors.
   - After a tie with paper (rounds 2, 26, 27), they have not shown a consistent pattern yet.
   - After losing with scissors (rounds 1, 8, 9, 14, 19), they tend to switch to rock or paper.

3. **Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent seems to switch moves after a loss, possibly trying to counter the move that beat them.
   - They have a slight preference for paper, but they do not consistently stick to one move after a tie.
   - The opponent might be using a strategy where they switch moves after a loss and occasionally repeat a move after a win.

4. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - Given the opponent's tendency to switch moves after a loss, I should consider playing the move that beats the move they just lost with.
   - Since they have a slight preference for paper, playing scissors might be beneficial, especially after they play paper.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing scissors against paper and rock against scissors.
   - Negative rewards were obtained when playing rock against paper and paper against scissors.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to switch moves after a loss, often trying to counter the move that beat them. They show a slight preference for paper but do not consistently stick to one move after a tie. Playing scissors can exploit their preference for paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent tends to switch moves after a loss and tries to counter the move that beat them. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, the opponent might not stick to paper. Given their slight preference for paper and the tendency to switch after a tie, they might play rock to counter scissors, which is a common counter to paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to switch moves after a loss, often trying to counter the move that beat them. They show a slight preference for paper but do not consistently stick to one move after a tie. Playing scissors can exploit their preference for paper.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 27: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent seems to play a mix of moves without a clear pattern. They might be playing randomly or using a complex strategy that is not immediately obvious. Further observation is needed to refine the hypothesis.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and observe patterns:

1. **Wins and Losses:**
   - When the opponent loses (e.g., they play rock and I play paper), they tend to switch their move in the next round. This is evident from rounds 5-6, 12-13, and 21-22.
   - When the opponent wins (e.g., they play paper and I play rock), they tend to repeat their move. This is seen in rounds 6-7 and 17-18.

2. **Ties:**
   - After a tie, the opponent does not consistently stick to one move. For example, after round 1 (tie with scissors), they switched to paper in round 2. After round 26 (tie with scissors), they switched to paper in round 27.

3. **Preference for Paper:**
   - The opponent shows a slight preference for playing paper, as seen in rounds 1, 2, 8, 9, 14, 17, and 27. This suggests that playing scissors could be a good counter-strategy.

4. **General Observations:**
   - The opponent seems to switch moves after a loss, often trying to counter the move that beat them.
   - They repeat their move after a win, indicating a tendency to stick with a successful strategy.
   - The pattern after ties is less clear, suggesting a more random or complex strategy.

Based on these observations, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches moves after a loss, often trying to counter the move that beat them. They repeat their move after a win. After a tie, their move is less predictable. They show a slight preference for paper, making scissors a potentially effective counter.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to their strategy, after a loss, they tend to switch moves to counter the move that beat them. Since 'paper' beat their 'rock', they might switch to 'scissors' to counter my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' to counter my 'paper', my best move would be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {11: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {11: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss. They show a slight preference for paper, which can be exploited by playing scissors. However, they might switch moves after consecutive plays of the same move.', 'value': 0.16629741000000003, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their plays and our interactions:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss.
   - There is a noticeable preference for playing "paper," which has been observed multiple times.
   - The opponent has played "paper" in rounds 0, 6, 17, 25, and 29, which suggests a recurring pattern or preference.

2. **Response to Wins and Losses**:
   - After winning with "paper" against our "rock" (rounds 6, 17, 25, and 29), the opponent tends to repeat or switch.
   - After losing, the opponent tends to switch their move, which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch after a loss.

3. **Static Strategy or Adaptive?**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be somewhat static with a preference for "paper," but they do adapt by switching moves after losses.
   - This indicates a semi-static strategy with some adaptive elements based on the outcome of the previous round.

4. **Our Performance**:
   - We have received positive rewards when playing "scissors" against their "paper" (rounds 0, 7, 13, 18, 22).
   - Playing "rock" has resulted in mixed outcomes, with losses against "paper" and wins against "scissors."

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as a preference for "paper" with a tendency to repeat after a win and switch after a loss.
   - This strategy can be exploited by playing "scissors" more frequently, especially after the opponent plays "paper."

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations, and we should continue to exploit the opponent's preference for "paper" by playing "scissors."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss. They show a preference for paper, which can be exploited by playing scissors. However, they might switch moves after consecutive plays of the same move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss. In the last round, they played paper and won against my rock. Therefore, it is likely that they will repeat their move and play paper again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper again, my best counter-move would be to play scissors, which beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Repetition and Switching Patterns**:
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win. For example, in rounds where they won, they often repeated the same move in the next round.
   - After a loss, they often switch their move. This is evident in rounds where they lost, and their subsequent move was different.
   - After a tie, they also tend to switch moves, although this pattern is less consistent.

2. **Preference for Paper**:
   - The opponent shows a preference for playing paper. This is observed in multiple rounds where they chose paper, and it aligns with the previous hypotheses.

3. **Exploiting the Pattern**:
   - Given the opponent's preference for paper and their tendency to repeat moves after a win, playing scissors has been effective. This is supported by the positive rewards received when playing scissors against their paper.

4. **Adjustments Based on Consecutive Plays**:
   - The opponent might switch moves after consecutive plays of the same move, indicating a potential adjustment strategy to avoid predictability.

5. **Static vs. Adaptive Strategy**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of static preferences (like favoring paper) and adaptive responses (like switching after a loss). This suggests they are not entirely random but follow a discernible pattern.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss. They show a preference for paper, which can be exploited by playing scissors. However, they might switch moves after consecutive plays of the same move. After a tie, their move is less predictable.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss. In the last round, they played paper and lost. According to their strategy, they are likely to switch from paper to another move. Given their preference for paper, they might switch to rock, which is a common move after losing with paper.

2. 'my_next_play': If the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent has played each of the three moves multiple times, but there seems to be a pattern in their responses to my plays.
   - When I played "scissors" (rounds 0, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 13, 18, 22, 26, 30), the opponent played "paper" or "rock" or "scissors".
   - When I played "paper" (rounds 2, 5, 8, 9, 12, 14, 16, 19, 21, 24, 27, 28, 31), the opponent played "scissors" or "rock" or "paper".
   - When I played "rock" (rounds 6, 10, 15, 17, 20, 23, 25, 29), the opponent played "paper" or "scissors".

2. **Response to My Moves**:
   - The opponent seems to frequently play the move that beats my last move. For example:
     - When I played "scissors" in round 30, they played "paper" in round 31.
     - When I played "paper" in round 28, they played "scissors" in round 29.
     - When I played "rock" in round 25, they played "paper" in round 26.

3. **Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent might be using a strategy where they frequently play the move that beats my last move. This is not consistent every time, but there is a noticeable trend.

4. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - If the opponent is indeed playing the move that beats my last move, I can counter this by playing the move that would beat the move they are likely to play next.

Based on this analysis, here's a concise hypothesis:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays the move that beats my last move. This is not consistent every time, but there is a noticeable trend.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of frequently playing the move that beats my last move, and since I last played paper, I predict their next play will be scissors to beat my paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: 
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss.
   - They show a slight preference for paper.
   - They often switch to the move that beats my last move after a loss.
   - After a tie, their move is less predictable, but they might switch moves.

2. **Interaction History**:
   - Wins: When I played rock, I won against scissors multiple times (rounds 10, 15, 20, 23, 32).
   - Losses: When I played paper, I lost to scissors multiple times (rounds 8, 9, 14, 19, 31).
   - Ties: Occurred when both played the same move (rounds 1, 2, 26, 27).

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to switch to the move that beats my last move after a loss (e.g., I played paper and lost to scissors).
   - They repeat their move after a win (e.g., they played scissors after winning with scissors).
   - They have a slight preference for paper, as seen in several rounds where they played paper.

4. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: 
     - After a win, they repeat their move.
     - After a loss, they switch to the move that beats my last move.
     - After a tie, they might switch moves, but it's less predictable.
     - They have a slight preference for paper, making scissors a potentially effective counter.

5. **Exploitation**:
   - Given the opponent's preference for paper and tendency to switch to the move that beats my last move after a loss, playing scissors could be a strong counter-strategy.
   - Additionally, playing rock has yielded positive rewards against their scissors plays.

Based on this analysis, here's the refined hypothesis:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches to the move that beats my last move after a loss. After a tie, their move is less predictable. They have a slight preference for paper, making scissors a potentially effective counter.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played rock and won against their scissors. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they tend to switch to the move that beats my last move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper to counter my previous rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.4089963, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.4089963, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat the move that won. For example:
   - Round 3: Opponent played 'rock' and won, repeated 'rock' in round 4.
   - Round 8: Opponent played 'scissors' and won, repeated 'scissors' in round 9.

2. **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they tend to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 5: Opponent played 'rock' and lost, switched to 'paper' in round 6.
   - Round 12: Opponent played 'rock' and lost, switched to 'paper' in round 13.

3. **Ties**: When the opponent ties, they switch their move. For example:
   - Round 1: Opponent played 'scissors' and tied, switched to 'paper' in round 2.
   - Round 26: Opponent played 'scissors' and tied, switched to 'paper' in round 27.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy appears to be:
- Repeat the move after a win.
- Switch the move after a loss.
- Switch the move after a tie.

This hypothesis aligns well with the observed data, and the previous hypothesis also supports this pattern. Therefore, I will continue to use this hypothesis to predict the opponent's next move and choose my counter strategy accordingly.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and won. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be 'rock' again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.58629741, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 32: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays the move that beats my last move. This is not consistent every time, but there is a noticeable trend.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 29: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches moves after a loss, often trying to counter the move that beat them. They repeat their move after a win. After a tie, their move is less predictable. They show a slight preference for paper, making scissors a potentially effective counter.', 'value': 0.155709, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation.
   - The opponent frequently plays the move that beats my last move, although this is not consistent every time.
   - The opponent switches moves after a loss, often trying to counter the move that beat them. They repeat their move after a win. After a tie, their move is less predictable. They show a slight preference for paper.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - Wins: When I play paper against rock, I win. This has happened multiple times (rounds 5, 12, 16, 21, 24, 28, 34).
   - Losses: When I play rock against paper, I lose (rounds 6, 17, 25, 29).
   - Ties: Ties occur when both play the same move (rounds 1, 2, 26, 27).

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to play rock frequently after I play paper, which suggests they might be trying to counter my paper with rock.
   - The opponent's behavior after a loss is to switch moves, often to the move that would counter my previous play.
   - There is a noticeable trend where the opponent plays rock after losing to paper, indicating a possible static strategy or a simple counter-strategy.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing paper has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially against rock.
   - Playing rock against paper has resulted in negative rewards.

**Conclusion**:
The opponent's strategy seems to involve switching moves after a loss, often trying to counter my last successful move. They tend to repeat their move after a win. There is a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper, suggesting a static or simple counter-strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches moves after a loss, often trying to counter the move that beat them. They repeat their move after a win. They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to switch moves after a loss and try to counter the move that beat them. In the last round, they played rock and lost to my paper. Therefore, they are likely to switch to scissors in an attempt to counter my paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best move would be to play rock to counter their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they won the last round with 'paper', it is likely that they will repeat 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper' again, my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.7972857309, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and lost, which suggests they are likely to switch their play. Historically, when they switch, they have alternated between 'rock' and 'scissors'. Given their pattern, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.25810001162999996, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.25810001162999996, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: 
   - The opponent was thought to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This hypothesis was not perfectly consistent but was a reasonable approximation.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their move. For example, in round 3, they played rock after winning with rock in round 2.
   - **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they tend to switch their move. For instance, in round 5, they switched from rock to paper after losing with rock in round 4.
   - **Ties**: When there's a tie, they also tend to switch. For example, in round 1, they switched from scissors to paper after tying with scissors in round 0.

3. **Current Observations**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the hypothesis that they repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. However, there are occasional deviations, suggesting some randomness or noise in their strategy.

4. **Static Strategy Check**:
   - Analyzing the rewards, playing scissors against their paper has often resulted in a win, while playing paper against their scissors has often resulted in a loss. This suggests they might favor paper slightly more, but it's not consistent enough to conclude a static strategy.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a mix of repeating moves after a win and switching after a loss or tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent, indicating some level of randomness or noise.

Based on this analysis, I will maintain the hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie, with some randomness.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their move. For example, in round 3, they played rock after winning with rock in round 2. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that they repeat their move after a win.

2. **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they often switch their move. For example, in round 4, they switched from rock to paper after losing to scissors. This supports the hypothesis that they switch after a loss.

3. **Ties**: After ties, the opponent's behavior is less predictable, but there is a tendency to switch moves. For instance, in round 1, after a tie with scissors, they switched to paper in round 2.

4. **Preference for Paper**: The opponent shows a slight preference for playing paper, as seen in rounds 2, 5, 8, 9, 14, and 19. This can be exploited by playing scissors more frequently.

5. **Static Strategy**: The opponent does not seem to adapt dynamically to my plays, indicating a more static strategy. They follow a pattern of repeating after wins and switching after losses, with a preference for paper.

Given these observations, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows: They repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and show a preference for paper. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and shows a preference for paper. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss, and considering their preference for paper, I anticipate that they will switch from scissors to paper in the next round since they lost the last round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Playing scissors can exploit their preference for paper.', 'value': 0.045899999999999996, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to switch moves after a loss, often trying to counter the move that beat them.
   - There is a pattern where the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.
   - The opponent has a slight preference for paper, but this is not consistent enough to be exploited directly.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The most consistent hypothesis is that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This hypothesis has been supported by multiple rounds and has a relatively high value.
   - Another hypothesis suggests that the opponent tends to switch moves after a loss, often trying to counter the move that beat them, with a slight preference for paper.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When playing scissors, I have received both positive and negative rewards, indicating that the opponent does not consistently play paper.
   - Playing paper has resulted in both wins and losses, suggesting the opponent does not consistently play rock.
   - Playing rock has also resulted in mixed outcomes, indicating no consistent pattern of the opponent playing scissors.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The most reliable hypothesis is that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This pattern, while not perfectly consistent, provides a reasonable basis for predicting their next move.

Given this analysis, I will continue to use the hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie to inform my strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they won the last round with rock, I predict their next play will be rock again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and lost. According to their strategy, they are likely to switch their play. Since they played 'paper', they might switch to 'rock' or 'scissors'. Given the pattern observed, it's more likely they will switch to 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.2753088689546541, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their move. For example, in round 3, they played rock and won, and in round 4, they played rock again. Similarly, in round 8, they played scissors and won, and in round 9, they played scissors again.

2. **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they tend to switch their move. For instance, in round 5, they played rock and lost, and in round 6, they switched to paper. In round 10, they played scissors and lost, and in round 11, they switched to rock.

3. **Ties**: When the opponent ties, they tend to switch their move. For example, in round 1, they played scissors and tied, and in round 2, they switched to paper. In round 26, they played scissors and tied, and in round 27, they switched to paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:
- After a win, they repeat their move.
- After a loss, they switch their move.
- After a tie, they switch their move.

This strategy is consistent with the observed data and aligns with the previous hypothesis. The opponent's behavior seems to follow a predictable pattern that can be exploited.

Given this hypothesis, I can use this information to inform my strategy. By predicting the opponent's next move based on their previous outcome, I can choose the counter move to maximize my reward.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and the opponent played scissors, resulting in a loss for me. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their move. This is evident from rounds where they won and played the same move in the subsequent round.

2. **Losses**: After a loss, the opponent switches their move. This is consistent with several rounds where they lost and then played a different move in the next round.

3. **Ties**: After a tie, the opponent also switches their move. This is observed in rounds where a tie occurred, and the opponent changed their move in the following round.

4. **Preference**: There seems to be a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper, as noted in one of the hypotheses.

5. **Static Strategy**: The opponent's strategy appears to be somewhat predictable, as they often switch moves after a loss or tie and repeat after a win. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Given these observations, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

- **Repeat** their move after a win.
- **Switch** their move after a loss.
- **Switch** their move after a tie.
- **Slight preference** for playing rock after losing to paper.

This strategy aligns well with the previous hypotheses, indicating that the opponent is likely following a consistent pattern that can be exploited.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they switch after a loss. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch to rock in the next round, as they show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.6449013457877806, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 43: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win.
   - After a loss, they switch their move.
   - After a tie, they switch their move as well.

2. **Recent Plays**:
   - In round 43, the opponent played "scissors" and lost to my "rock". In round 44, they switched to "rock", which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch after a loss.
   - In round 42, the opponent played "scissors" and won against my "paper". They repeated "scissors" in round 43, which aligns with the hypothesis that they repeat after a win.

3. **Static Preference**:
   - There is a noted preference for playing "rock" after losing to "paper". This was observed in the transition from round 43 to 44.

4. **Consistency**:
   - The opponent's behavior is not perfectly consistent but follows the pattern of repeating after a win and switching after a loss or tie.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play "paper", I often receive a positive reward, especially when the opponent plays "rock". This suggests that the opponent might have a slight bias towards playing "rock" after losing to "paper".

Based on this analysis, the previous hypothesis still holds well. The opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.'
}
```

This hypothesis will guide my strategy in future rounds, particularly by anticipating the opponent's tendency to play "rock" after losing to "paper".

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. In the last round, they played rock and lost to my paper. According to their strategy, they are likely to switch their play. Given their slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper, they might switch to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.23193000000000008, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Top hypotheses: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine their behavior in the interaction history:

1. **Wins:** The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win. For example:
   - Round 0: Opponent plays paper and loses, switches to scissors in Round 1.
   - Round 1: Opponent plays scissors and ties, switches to paper in Round 2.
   - Round 3: Opponent plays rock and wins, repeats rock in Round 4.
   - Round 5: Opponent plays rock and loses, switches to paper in Round 6.
   - Round 10: Opponent plays scissors and loses, switches to rock in Round 11.
   - Round 12: Opponent plays rock and loses, switches to paper in Round 13.
   - Round 15: Opponent plays scissors and loses, switches to rock in Round 16.
   - Round 20: Opponent plays scissors and loses, switches to rock in Round 21.
   - Round 23: Opponent plays scissors and loses, switches to rock in Round 24.
   - Round 28: Opponent plays rock and loses, switches to paper in Round 29.
   - Round 30: Opponent plays paper and loses, switches to scissors in Round 31.
   - Round 32: Opponent plays scissors and loses, switches to rock in Round 33.
   - Round 34: Opponent plays rock and loses, switches to paper in Round 35.
   - Round 36: Opponent plays paper and loses, switches to scissors in Round 37.
   - Round 38: Opponent plays scissors and loses, switches to rock in Round 39.
   - Round 40: Opponent plays rock and loses, switches to paper in Round 41.
   - Round 43: Opponent plays scissors and loses, switches to rock in Round 44.
   - Round 46: Opponent plays paper and loses, switches to scissors in Round 47.

2. **Losses:** The opponent switches their move after a loss. This is consistent with the above observations.

3. **Ties:** The opponent switches their move after a tie. For example:
   - Round 1: Opponent plays scissors and ties, switches to paper in Round 2.
   - Round 26: Opponent plays scissors and ties, switches to paper in Round 27.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows: after a win, they repeat their move; after a loss, they switch their move; and after a tie, they switch their move. This pattern is consistent with the previous hypotheses and the observed data.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and won, so I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.49474081312364615, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 43: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and the hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss and a tie.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move.
   - There is a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.

2. **Hypotheses Review:**
   - The most recent hypothesis (round 48) suggests that the opponent switches after a loss or tie and repeats after a win. This hypothesis has been consistent in previous rounds (26, 43, 34, 45).
   - The opponent's behavior is not perfectly consistent but follows a recognizable pattern.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing "rock" has yielded positive rewards frequently, especially when the opponent is predicted to play "scissors" based on their pattern of switching after a loss or tie.

4. **Strategy Refinement:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating after a win and switching after a loss or tie. This aligns with the hypothesis from round 48 and previous rounds.
   - Given the positive outcomes when playing "rock," it seems the opponent's strategy can be exploited by anticipating their switch to "scissors."

**Conclusion:**
The opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows: they repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. This pattern allows us to predict their next move and counter it effectively.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or a tie, the opponent switches their move. They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing with scissors against my rock in the last round, they are likely to switch their move. Given their slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper, they might choose rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, I should play paper in the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History**: 
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to switch their move after a loss and a tie, and repeat their move after a win. This pattern is consistent with the hypotheses provided.
   - The opponent has played 'rock' after losing to 'paper' multiple times, indicating a slight preference for 'rock' in such scenarios.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern has been observed in the interaction history.
   - The opponent shows a slight preference for playing 'rock' after losing to 'paper', which aligns with the observed behavior.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When playing 'paper', I have received positive rewards when the opponent played 'rock', which aligns with the prediction that the opponent tends to play 'rock' after losing to 'paper'.

4. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - The existing hypothesis seems to explain the opponent's behavior well. The opponent's strategy appears to be a simple pattern of repeating after a win and switching after a loss or tie, with a preference for 'rock' after losing to 'paper'.

Based on the above analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. In the last round, they played rock and lost to my paper. According to their strategy, they are likely to switch their play. Given their slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper, they might switch to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.73655199, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. According to the strategy, they will repeat their move after a win. Therefore, their likely play in the next round is 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter move would be 'scissors' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win.
   - After a loss, they switch their move.
   - After a tie, they also switch their move.
   - There is a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.

2. **Recent Plays**:
   - Round 51: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won. In round 52, opponent switched to scissors.
   - Round 50: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost. In round 51, opponent switched to paper.
   - Round 49: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won. In round 50, opponent switched to paper.

3. **Hypotheses Evaluation**:
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the hypothesis that they repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie.
   - The opponent's preference for playing rock after losing to paper is not consistently observed in the recent rounds.

4. **Strategy Consistency**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be consistent with the hypothesis that they repeat after a win and switch after a loss or tie, with occasional deviations.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are achieved when I anticipate their switch after a loss or tie and play the counter move.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and given that they won the last round with scissors, I predict they will repeat their move and play scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to be distributed across rock, paper, and scissors without a clear pattern.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats the same move consecutively (e.g., rock in rounds 4 and 5, scissors in rounds 8 and 9).

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played rock 14 times, paper 13 times, and scissors 13 times in the 50 rounds analyzed.
   - The opponent's choice does not seem to depend on the outcome of the previous round (win, lose, or tie).

3. **Static Strategy Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent might be playing a random strategy, selecting each move with approximately equal probability.
   - There is no evidence of the opponent adapting to my plays or following a deterministic pattern based on previous outcomes.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play rock, I have a mixed result of wins, losses, and ties.
   - When I play paper, I generally have a positive reward, indicating that the opponent might play rock slightly more often.
   - When I play scissors, I also have a mixed result.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be random or nearly random, with no clear bias towards any particular move.
   - Given the slight edge when playing paper, it might be beneficial to lean towards playing paper more often.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is that the opponent is employing a random strategy with no discernible pattern or adaptation to my plays.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent appears to be playing a random strategy with no discernible pattern or adaptation to my plays. There is a slight indication that they might play rock slightly more often, but overall, their strategy seems random.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the previous analysis that the opponent's strategy appears random with a slight tendency to play rock more often, and considering the last play was rock, it's reasonable to predict that the opponent might continue with rock or switch randomly. However, given the slight tendency towards rock, I predict their next play might be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.28928108846169126, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 50: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.', 'value': 0.26009999999999994, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 45: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.', 'value': 0.249845007, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.', 'value': 0.249845007, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: 
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. 
   - There is a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - When I played paper and won, the opponent played rock (rounds 5, 12, 16, 21, 24, 28, 34, 40, 44, 49).
   - When I played rock and lost, the opponent played paper (rounds 6, 17, 25, 29, 35, 45, 50).
   - When I played scissors and won, the opponent played paper (rounds 7, 13, 18, 22, 30, 36, 41, 46, 51).
   - When I played paper and lost, the opponent played scissors (rounds 8, 9, 14, 19, 31, 37, 42, 47, 52, 54).
   - When I played rock and won, the opponent played scissors (rounds 10, 15, 20, 23, 32, 38, 43, 48).
   - When I played scissors and lost, the opponent played rock (rounds 11, 33, 39).

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win, as seen in rounds where they won with scissors and continued with scissors.
   - They switch after a loss, often to rock after losing to paper, as seen in rounds where they lost with paper and switched to rock.
   - They switch after a tie, but this is less consistent.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and showing a preference for rock after losing to paper.

5. **Strategy Implication**:
   - Given the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win and switch after a loss, I should anticipate their next move based on their last result.
   - If they lost with scissors, they might switch to rock, so I should play paper.
   - If they won with scissors, they might repeat scissors, so I should play rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and shows a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss, and given that they won the last round with scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. For example, when they lose with scissors, they often switch to rock.
   - After a win, they tend to repeat their move. However, this pattern is not perfectly consistent.
   - After a tie, they tend to switch their move as well.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.
   - They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.

3. **Current Observations**:
   - In the recent rounds, the opponent has been playing scissors frequently, and switching to rock after losing to paper.
   - My strategy of playing rock has been yielding positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of switching after a loss and repeating after a win, with a slight preference for rock after losing to paper.
   - Given the positive rewards when I play rock, it suggests the opponent might be playing a static strategy that can be exploited by consistently playing rock.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit the opponent's tendency to play scissors and their preference for rock after losing to paper by playing rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and shows a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper. They have a tendency to play scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss, and considering their tendency to play scissors frequently, the opponent played scissors in the last round and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch from scissors to rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

They have a tendency to play scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent seems to switch their play after a loss. For instance, when they lost with rock against paper, they switched to scissors.
   - After winning, they tend to repeat their move. For example, if they won with scissors, they played scissors again.
   - There is a noted preference for playing rock after losing to paper, which has been observed multiple times.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and shows a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.
   - They have a tendency to play scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the hypothesis that they switch after a loss and repeat after a win.
   - The preference for rock after losing to paper is consistent with the observed data.
   - The frequent play of scissors suggests that playing rock could be a beneficial strategy.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards are often obtained when playing rock, especially after the opponent has played scissors or after they have lost with paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and shows a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

This hypothesis suggests that playing rock could be a strong counter-strategy, especially after the opponent has lost with paper or played scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss. In the last round, they played rock and lost to my paper. According to the strategy, they are likely to switch from rock to another move. Given their slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper, they might switch to scissors to counter my paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round, my best counter move would be to play rock, which beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.8293563893396521, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they lost the last round (since I played scissors and they played paper), they are likely to switch their play. Given their pattern, they might switch from paper to rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.2805494725377564, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 56: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and shows a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper. They have a tendency to play scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.18978639299999994, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Observation**: The opponent seems to have a tendency to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. This pattern is consistent with the hypotheses provided in rounds 26, 34, and 48.

2. **Preference for Scissors**: The hypothesis from round 56 suggests a tendency for the opponent to play scissors frequently, which aligns with the observed history where scissors appear often.

3. **Static Strategy Check**: When I play rock, I often receive a positive reward, indicating that the opponent might be playing scissors frequently or has a bias towards it. This is evident from the rounds where I won with rock against scissors.

4. **Recent Plays**: In the most recent rounds, the opponent played scissors after losing with rock (round 58) and then played scissors again in round 59, which they won. This supports the hypothesis that they repeat a winning move.

5. **Counter Strategy**: Given the opponent's tendency to play scissors frequently and repeat winning moves, playing rock seems to be a beneficial strategy. This aligns with the hypothesis from round 56, which suggests exploiting the opponent's preference for scissors by playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and shows a preference for playing scissors frequently. This can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss, and their preference for playing scissors, I believe their next play will be rock. This is because they won the last round with scissors, so they might switch to rock, which is a common pattern observed in their strategy.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win. This is evident from several rounds where they won and played the same move again.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move. This is consistent with the hypothesis that they change their strategy to try and win the next round.
   - After a tie, the opponent also switches their move, which aligns with the idea of trying to break the tie by changing their strategy.
   - There is a noted preference for playing scissors frequently, which has been exploited by playing rock.

2. **Hypotheses Evaluation**:
   - The previous hypotheses consistently predict the opponent's next move as scissors, suggesting a strong tendency towards this move.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating successful moves and switching unsuccessful ones, with a bias towards scissors.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors frequently.
   - The strategy of playing rock seems effective against the opponent's tendency to play scissors.

4. **Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: repeat the move after a win, switch after a loss or tie, with a frequent inclination towards scissors.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations and can be used to inform future plays.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, it is likely that they will play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: 
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - They show a preference for playing scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.
   - After losing to paper, they have a slight tendency to play rock.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played scissors frequently, and playing rock has often resulted in a win for me.
   - When I played rock, I won against scissors multiple times (rounds 15, 20, 23, 32, 38, 43, 48, 55, 61).
   - When I played paper, I often won against rock (rounds 12, 16, 21, 24, 28, 34, 40, 44, 49, 56).
   - When I played scissors, I won against paper (rounds 13, 18, 22, 30, 36, 41, 46, 51, 58).

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, which aligns with the hypothesis that they can be exploited by playing rock.
   - They switch moves after a loss, which suggests they are not sticking to a static strategy but rather adapting based on the outcome.
   - The opponent's tendency to play rock after losing to paper is observed, but not consistently.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy involves repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie.
   - They have a tendency to play scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.
   - There is a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper, but this is not consistent enough to rely on.

Based on this analysis, the previous hypotheses still hold true and provide a reasonable explanation of the opponent's behavior. Therefore, I will continue to exploit their tendency to play scissors by playing rock.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and shows a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss, and given that they lost the last round with scissors, they are likely to switch. Since they have a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper, their next play is likely to be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.7532284690804504, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they lost the last round where they played rock, they are likely to switch. Historically, when they switch from rock, they tend to play scissors. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter-move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win.
   - They switch their move after a loss.
   - They switch their move after a tie.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent frequently plays scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - The opponent shows a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.
   - They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - In the last round (63), the opponent played paper after winning with paper in round 62.
   - This supports the hypothesis that they repeat their move after a win.
   - The opponent's frequent play of scissors suggests a tendency that can be exploited.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards are often obtained when playing rock, indicating the opponent's frequent play of scissors.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win.
   - They switch their move after a loss or tie.
   - They have a tendency to play scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating moves after a win and switching after a loss or tie, with a frequent play of scissors.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and frequently plays scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie, and considering they won the last round with paper, it is likely they will repeat their move and play paper again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's likely strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to switch their move after a loss and a tie, and they repeat their move after a win. This pattern is consistent with several rounds in the interaction history.
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, which suggests a tendency that can be exploited by playing rock.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This pattern aligns with the observed data.
   - The opponent's frequent use of scissors is noted, which can be countered by playing rock.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing scissors has often resulted in positive rewards, especially when predicting the opponent's play as paper.
   - Playing rock has also been successful against the opponent's frequent scissors plays.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be: repeat the move after a win, switch after a loss or tie, and they have a tendency to play scissors frequently.
   - This strategy can be exploited by playing rock more often, especially after observing a pattern of scissors plays.

Based on the above analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and frequently plays scissors. This can be exploited by playing rock more often.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie, and given that they lost the last round with paper, they are likely to switch from paper. Since they frequently play scissors, it's likely they will switch to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.021357364894594444, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.013126878648954232, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 48: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.010679179350056967, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see if any patterns emerge:

1. **Wins and Losses:**
   - When I win (e.g., round 16, 18, 20), the opponent tends to switch their move in the next round.
   - When I lose (e.g., round 17, 19, 25), the opponent tends to repeat their winning move in the next round.

2. **Ties:**
   - In cases of ties (e.g., round 26, 27), the opponent switches their move in the next round.

3. **Pattern Consistency:**
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern where they repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. This pattern is consistent with the previous hypotheses.

4. **Static Strategy Check:**
   - When I play rock, I have mixed results (wins and losses), indicating the opponent is not playing a static strategy that can be easily exploited by consistently playing one move.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: "After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move."

Given this analysis, the previous hypotheses about the opponent's strategy seem to hold. The opponent's behavior is reasonably consistent with the pattern described.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after winning with paper against my rock, they are likely to repeat their move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of paper, I should play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their move. This is evident from rounds where they won and played the same move in the subsequent round.

2. **Losses**: After losing, the opponent switches their move. This behavior is consistent with the rounds where they lost and changed their move in the next round.

3. **Ties**: After a tie, the opponent also switches their move. This is observed in rounds where a tie occurred, and the opponent played a different move afterward.

4. **Preference for Scissors**: There is a noticeable tendency for the opponent to play scissors frequently. This can be exploited by playing rock more often.

5. **Static Strategy**: The opponent seems to follow a relatively static strategy where they repeat after wins and switch after losses or ties. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

6. **Exploitation Strategy**: Given the frequent play of scissors by the opponent, playing rock has yielded positive rewards. This suggests that the opponent's strategy can be countered effectively by anticipating their frequent use of scissors.

Based on these observations, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They have a tendency to play scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (where they played paper against my scissors), they are likely to switch their move. Given their tendency to play scissors frequently, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted scissors play by the opponent, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {56: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and shows a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper. They have a tendency to play scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.49910366910000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 67: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They have a tendency to play scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 61: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python

                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to play scissors frequently, as noted in previous hypotheses.
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their move.
   - After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.
   - There is a noted preference for playing rock after losing to paper.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - The opponent has a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

3. **Recent Plays:**
   - In round 67, the opponent played scissors, and I played rock, resulting in a win for me.
   - This aligns with the hypothesis that the opponent frequently plays scissors.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing rock has consistently yielded positive rewards, especially against the opponent's frequent scissors plays.
   - This suggests that the opponent's strategy might be static or predictable, with a bias towards scissors.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie.
   - They have a tendency to play scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and frequently plays scissors. This can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss or tie, and frequently playing scissors, I anticipate that they will switch their play after losing with scissors in the last round. Given their tendency to play scissors frequently, they might switch to paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my best move would be to play scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {26: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.24432557615884593, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to switch moves after a loss and repeat moves after a win. This is evident from rounds where they lost and switched their move in the subsequent round.
   - The opponent seems to have a preference for playing rock, especially after losing to paper. This is observed in several instances where they switched to rock after losing to paper.
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.
   - The opponent shows a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper and tends to play scissors frequently.

3. **Current Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie. They have a tendency to play rock after losing to paper and frequently play scissors.
   - This strategy is not perfectly consistent, but it provides a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - When playing rock, I have generally received positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors frequently.
   - Playing paper has also been successful when predicting the opponent's switch to rock after losing to paper.

**Conclusion:**
The opponent's strategy involves repeating moves after a win, switching after a loss or tie, and showing a preference for rock after losing to paper. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and shows a preference for playing rock after losing to paper. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent won with rock against my scissors. According to the opponent's strategy, they are likely to repeat their winning move, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move is paper, as it beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their move. For example, in round 25, they played paper after winning with paper in round 24.

2. **Losses**: After a loss, the opponent switches their move. For instance, after losing with scissors in round 26, they switched to paper in round 27.

3. **Ties**: After a tie, the opponent also switches their move. For example, after tying with scissors in round 26, they switched to paper in round 27.

4. **Preference for Rock**: The opponent shows a preference for playing rock after losing to paper. This is evident in rounds 29, 35, 39, 45, 50, 57, 63, and 65, where they played rock after losing to paper.

5. **Frequent Scissors**: The opponent frequently plays scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock. This is seen in rounds 20, 23, 30, 32, 36, 38, 41, 43, 46, 48, 51, 55, 58, 61, 64, and 67.

Overall, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows: they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss or tie, and show a preference for playing rock after losing to paper. They also frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

Given this analysis, my strategy should focus on playing paper when predicting the opponent will play rock and playing rock when predicting the opponent will play scissors.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and shows a preference for playing rock after losing to paper. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss. In the last round, they lost with rock against my paper. According to the strategy, they are likely to switch from rock to another move. Given their preference for playing scissors frequently, it is likely they will switch to scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: 
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This pattern is observed in several rounds, such as:
     - Round 21: Opponent plays rock and loses, switches to paper in round 22.
     - Round 22: Opponent plays paper and loses, switches to scissors in round 23.
     - Round 23: Opponent plays scissors and loses, switches to rock in round 24.
     - This pattern continues with some consistency, indicating a tendency to switch after a loss.

2. **Hypotheses Evaluation**:
   - Previous hypotheses suggest the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This is consistent with the observed behavior.
   - The opponent shows a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper, which is noted in the hypothesis from round 62.

3. **Static Strategy Check**:
   - When playing rock, I received a negative reward multiple times (rounds 25, 29, 35, 45, 50, 57, 63, 65, 70), indicating that the opponent may counter rock effectively.
   - Playing paper has generally resulted in positive rewards, suggesting the opponent might be vulnerable to paper.

4. **Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating moves after wins and switching after losses or ties. They may also have a slight preference for rock after losing to paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent's strategy suggests that they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. In the last round, the opponent played paper and won. According to their strategy, they are likely to repeat their winning move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, I should play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: 
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. 
   - They have a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.
   - They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has shown a pattern of playing scissors frequently, as seen in rounds 23, 30, 32, 38, 43, 48, 55, 61, 67, and 71.
   - When the opponent wins, they often repeat their move, as seen in rounds 25 (after winning with paper), 33 (after winning with rock), and 39 (after winning with rock).
   - When the opponent loses, they tend to switch their move, as seen in rounds 24 (switching from scissors to rock), 28 (switching from paper to rock), and 34 (switching from rock to paper).
   - After ties, they also switch their move, as seen in rounds 26 (switching from scissors to paper) and 27 (switching from paper to rock).

3. **Current Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win.
   - The opponent switches their move after a loss or tie.
   - They have a preference for playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.
   - They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially against the opponent's frequent scissors plays.
   - Playing paper has been less successful, often resulting in losses against scissors.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating moves after wins and switching after losses or ties, with a frequent inclination towards playing scissors.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and frequently plays scissors. They have a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent last played scissors and won, according to their strategy, they are likely to repeat their winning move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to frequently play scissors, which has been exploited by playing rock.
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their move.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

2. **Consistency and Deviations**:
   - The opponent's behavior is not perfectly consistent but follows a recognizable pattern.
   - There is a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has often resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - The strategy of predicting the opponent's next move as scissors and countering with rock has been effective.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss or tie, with a frequent tendency to play scissors.
   - This pattern suggests a static strategy that can be exploited by consistently playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy remains consistent with previous observations and effectively explains the data observed so far.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and frequently plays scissors. They have a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss or tie, and frequently plays scissors. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Based on their strategy, they are likely to switch from scissors. Given their slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper, they might play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

They have a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss or tie. This is evident from multiple instances where they lost or tied and then changed their move.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but appears frequently enough to be noted.
   - There is a noticeable preference for playing rock after losing to paper, as seen in recent rounds.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - The opponent has a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper, which aligns with the recent rounds where they played rock after losing to paper.

3. **Static Strategy Consideration**:
   - When I play paper, I often receive a positive reward, indicating that the opponent might be playing a strategy that is vulnerable to paper. This is supported by the frequent prediction of the opponent playing rock.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows: They repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss or tie, and have a tendency to play rock after losing to paper. This strategy is not perfectly consistent but provides a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit the opponent's tendency to play rock by frequently playing paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and frequently plays rock after losing to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. In the last round, they played rock and lost to my paper. Therefore, they are likely to switch their move. Given their tendency to play rock after losing to paper, they might switch to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.8122141296520469, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they lost the last round (since I played scissors and they played paper), they are likely to switch their play. Given their pattern, they might switch to rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.2685498907564329, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 48: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.2553837306392217, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.2685498907564329, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 48: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the hypothesis that after a win, they repeat their move, and after a loss or tie, they switch their move.

2. **Interaction History**:
   - When I played paper and won against rock, the opponent switched to paper in the next round.
   - When I played rock and lost to paper, the opponent repeated paper in the next round.
   - When I played scissors and won against paper, the opponent switched to scissors in the next round.
   - When I played paper and lost to scissors, the opponent repeated scissors in the next round.

3. **Hypothesis Evaluation**:
   - The previous hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie seems to hold true for most rounds.
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a simple pattern of repeating after a win and switching after a loss or tie.

4. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - Given the observed pattern, the opponent is likely to repeat their move after winning and switch after losing or tying. This suggests a predictable pattern that can be exploited.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing rock against scissors and scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing paper against scissors and rock against paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie, and given that they won the last round with scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to play scissors frequently, as seen in many rounds where I played rock and won.
   - The opponent switches their move after a loss or tie, which is consistent with the hypothesis that they switch after a loss or tie.
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win, which aligns with the hypothesis that they repeat after a win.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The hypotheses consistently predict the opponent's next move as scissors, suggesting a pattern where the opponent frequently plays scissors.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve switching moves after a loss or tie and repeating moves after a win.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, indicating that the opponent frequently plays scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a combination of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie. They also show a preference for playing scissors, which can be exploited by consistently playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie, and considering that they played scissors in the last round and lost, they are likely to switch their move. Given their frequent use of scissors, they might switch to rock or paper. However, since they tend to play scissors often, they might switch to paper to counter my frequent rock plays.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely switch to paper, my best move would be scissors, as it beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They show a preference for playing rock after losing to paper.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.6415894464706521, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 48: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.6351380280132186, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 78: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 75: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and frequently plays rock after losing to paper.', 'value': 0.48206999999999994, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 71: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win.
   - They switch their move after a loss or a tie.
   - There is a noticeable preference for playing rock after losing to paper.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - They have a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.

3. **Recent Rounds**:
   - Round 78: I played rock, opponent played scissors (I won).
   - Round 79: I played scissors, opponent played rock (I lost).

   In round 78, the opponent played scissors after losing to paper in round 77, which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch after a loss. In round 79, they played rock after losing to scissors, which also aligns with the hypothesis that they switch after a loss.

4. **Pattern Consistency**:
   - The opponent's behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that they repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. They also show a preference for playing rock after losing to paper.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play paper, I often win against their rock, suggesting they frequently play rock after losing to paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They show a preference for playing rock after losing to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie, and considering they won the last round with rock, I predict their next play will be rock again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. For example, after losing with scissors to rock, they switch to rock.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move. For instance, after winning with paper against rock, they play paper again.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For instance, after a tie with rock, they switch to paper.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - Hypothesis 48 suggests that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This hypothesis has the highest value, indicating it fits the observed data well.
   - Other hypotheses also suggest similar patterns, with slight variations, such as a preference for playing rock after losing to paper.

3. **Consistency Check:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems consistent with Hypothesis 48, as they repeat moves after wins and switch after losses or ties.

4. **Static Strategy Check:**
   - When playing rock, I have received both positive and negative rewards, indicating the opponent is not playing a static strategy that can be easily exploited by consistently playing one move.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy is likely to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. This pattern is consistent with the observed data and previous hypotheses.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to use Hypothesis 48 to predict the opponent's next move and inform my strategy.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played paper and I played rock, resulting in their win), they are likely to repeat their move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.', 'value': 0.318291, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. For example, when they lost with rock against paper, they switched to scissors.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. For instance, when they won with scissors against paper, they played scissors again.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For example, when both played rock, the opponent switched to scissors.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - There is a noted preference for playing rock after losing to paper, but this is not a dominant pattern.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing scissors has often resulted in positive rewards, especially when predicting the opponent's next move as paper.
   - The strategy of playing scissors after predicting the opponent's move as paper has been effective.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: "The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper."

Given this analysis, the previous hypotheses align well with the observed data. The strategy of playing scissors when predicting the opponent's next move as paper has been successful, and this pattern should continue to be exploited.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. In the last round, they played paper and lost to my scissors. According to their strategy, they are likely to switch their play. Given their slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by my opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {82: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 48: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.10659664052597384, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: The most recent hypothesis suggests that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This hypothesis has been consistent in explaining the opponent's behavior in several rounds.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: When the opponent wins (e.g., round 35, 45, 50, 57, 63, 70, 75, 81), they tend to repeat their move in the next round.
   - **Losses**: When the opponent loses (e.g., round 34, 36, 38, 40, 41, 43, 44, 46, 48, 49, 51, 55, 56, 58, 61, 62, 64, 66, 67, 69, 71, 73, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82), they switch their move in the next round.
   - **Ties**: There are fewer instances of ties, but when they occur (e.g., round 53), the opponent switches their move.

3. **Pattern Consistency**: The opponent's behavior aligns well with the hypothesis that they repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

4. **Static Strategy Consideration**: Given the consistent pattern of switching after losses and ties, it seems unlikely that the opponent is playing a static strategy. Instead, they appear to follow a simple reactive strategy based on the outcome of the previous round.

5. **Reward Analysis**: When I play rock, I tend to win against scissors, which the opponent plays after losing with paper. When I play paper, I win against rock, which the opponent plays after losing with scissors. This suggests that the opponent's strategy can be exploited by predicting their next move based on the previous round's outcome.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the observed data, and I will continue to use it to inform my strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after winning with scissors in the last round, they are likely to repeat their move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. For example, when they played scissors and lost to rock, they switched to paper in the next round.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. For instance, when they won with paper against rock, they played paper again in the next round.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For example, when both played rock, the opponent switched to scissors in the next round.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent switches their move after a loss or tie and repeats their move after a win. This pattern has been observed multiple times and aligns with the interaction history.

3. **Static Strategy Consideration:**
   - When playing rock, I have received positive rewards frequently, indicating that the opponent might have a tendency to play scissors often or switch to it after a loss or tie.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be: after a win, they repeat their move; after a loss or tie, they switch their move. This strategy is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit this pattern by playing rock, as it has yielded positive rewards against their likely next move, scissors.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round with scissors against my rock, they are likely to switch their move. Since they lost with scissors, they might switch to rock in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {82: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.5197733567878258, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 75: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and frequently plays rock after losing to paper.', 'value': 0.5010060534299999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 85: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to play "rock" frequently after losing to "paper" (e.g., rounds 40, 44, 49, 56, 62, 69, 74, 80, 85).
   - After winning with "scissors" against "paper", the opponent often switches to "rock" (e.g., rounds 37, 42, 47, 52, 59, 72, 77, 83).
   - After losing with "scissors" against "rock", the opponent switches to "rock" (e.g., rounds 38, 43, 48, 55, 61, 67, 73, 78, 84).

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent switches their move after a loss or tie and repeats their move after a win.
   - The opponent frequently plays "rock" after losing to "paper".

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve switching moves after a loss or tie and repeating moves after a win.
   - The opponent has a tendency to play "rock" after losing to "paper", which aligns with the observed pattern.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing "paper" against the opponent's "rock" has consistently yielded positive rewards.
   - Playing "scissors" against the opponent's "paper" has also been successful.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. The opponent frequently plays rock after losing to paper.'
}
```

This hypothesis suggests that the opponent is likely to play "rock" after losing to "paper", and they switch moves after a loss or tie. This information can be used to inform my strategy in future rounds.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing to paper, they frequently switch to rock. Since I played paper in the last round and won, it is likely that the opponent will play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, I should play paper in the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.7599, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they switch their move. In the last round, both of us played paper, resulting in a tie. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to switch from paper to scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a tie. For example, after a tie in round 53 (rock vs. rock), they switched to scissors in round 54.
   - After a loss, the opponent also switches their move. For instance, after losing with scissors in round 42, they switched to rock in round 43.
   - After a win, the opponent repeats their move. For example, after winning with rock in round 39, they played rock again in round 40.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The most consistent hypothesis is that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This aligns with the interaction history.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent frequently plays rock after losing to paper is also supported by the data, as seen in rounds 43 and 55.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing rock has often resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors. This suggests that the opponent might be playing a strategy that involves playing scissors frequently after certain conditions.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be:
- **After a win, repeat the move.**
- **After a loss, switch the move.**
- **After a tie, switch the move.**
- **Frequently play rock after losing to paper.**

This strategy is consistent with the observed data and previous hypotheses. The opponent's tendency to switch moves after a loss or tie and repeat after a win is evident.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. The opponent frequently plays rock after losing to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to switch their move after a tie. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to switch from rock. Given their tendency to play rock after losing to paper, they might switch to paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {82: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.46235100000000007, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

            You last played: scissors

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {82: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.46235100000000007, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see if the previous hypothesis still holds or if it needs refinement.

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches their move after a loss, and switches their move after a tie.

2. **Analyzing Recent Rounds**:
   - **Round 86**: Tie (Paper vs. Paper), opponent plays Rock next (Round 87).
   - **Round 87**: Tie (Rock vs. Rock), opponent plays Scissors next (Round 88).
   - **Round 88**: Tie (Scissors vs. Scissors), we don't have the next move yet.

   From the above rounds, after a tie, the opponent switched their move, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play Rock, I often win against Scissors.
   - When I play Paper, I often win against Rock.
   - When I play Scissors, I often win against Paper.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems consistent with the previous hypothesis. They switch their move after a tie and a loss, and repeat their move after a win.

Given this analysis, I will continue to use the previous hypothesis as it still explains the observed data well.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they switch their move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to switch from scissors. The opponent's previous play before the tie was rock, so they might switch to paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent might repeat their move.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {82: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.023645700000000103, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches their move after a loss, and switches their move after a tie.

2. **Recent Rounds Analysis**:
   - **Round 86**: Tie with 'paper' vs 'paper'. Next round (87), opponent plays 'rock'. This supports the hypothesis that they switch after a tie.
   - **Round 87**: Tie with 'rock' vs 'rock'. Next round (88), opponent plays 'scissors'. This supports the hypothesis that they switch after a tie.
   - **Round 88**: Tie with 'scissors' vs 'scissors'. Next round (89), opponent plays 'scissors'. This contradicts the hypothesis that they switch after a tie.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - After a win: The opponent seems to repeat their move.
   - After a loss: The opponent switches their move.
   - After a tie: Initially, it seemed they switched, but recent rounds show they might repeat the move.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play 'rock' against 'scissors' and 'paper' against 'rock'.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play 'rock' against 'paper' and 'paper' against 'scissors'.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win.
   - The opponent switches their move after a loss.
   - The opponent might repeat their move after a tie, as seen in the last two rounds.

Given this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating and switching based on the outcome. The previous hypothesis needs slight adjustment for ties.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent might repeat their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they might repeat their move. Since the last two rounds ended in a tie with both playing scissors, it is likely that the opponent will play scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {61: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {61: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and see if there are any patterns:

1. **Wins and Losses:**
   - When the opponent wins, they tend to switch their move. For example:
     - Round 42: Opponent wins with scissors against paper, then plays scissors again in round 43.
     - Round 45: Opponent wins with paper against rock, then plays paper again in round 46.
   - When the opponent loses, they also tend to switch their move. For example:
     - Round 41: Opponent loses with paper against scissors, then switches to scissors in round 42.
     - Round 43: Opponent loses with scissors against rock, then switches to rock in round 44.

2. **Ties:**
   - When there is a tie, the opponent tends to switch their move. For example:
     - Round 53: Tie with rock, opponent switches to scissors in round 54.
     - Round 86: Tie with paper, opponent switches to rock in round 87.

3. **Move Preferences:**
   - The opponent shows a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, as observed in rounds 42, 47, 52, 59, 60, 72, 77, 83, 88, and 89.

4. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern of switching moves after both wins and losses, and they also switch after ties. This suggests a strategy where they are trying to avoid being predictable by not repeating the same move after any outcome.

5. **Exploitation Strategy:**
   - Given the opponent's frequent inclination towards scissors and their tendency to switch moves, playing rock could be a beneficial strategy as it counters scissors and can handle the switch pattern effectively.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches their move after both wins and losses, and also after ties. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of switching their move after both wins and losses, and also after ties, and given their frequent inclination towards playing scissors, I predict that after playing 'paper' in the last round, they are likely to switch to 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win. For instance, in rounds 42 and 43, they played scissors after winning with scissors.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move. For example, in round 44, they lost with rock and switched to paper in round 45.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For instance, in round 53, both played rock, and the opponent switched to scissors in round 54.

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent shows a tendency to play paper after losing to rock, as seen in rounds 90 and 91.
   - The opponent has a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

3. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.
   - The opponent's frequent inclination towards scissors is noted, suggesting a strategy to counter with rock.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are often received when playing rock, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing rock against the opponent's paper, indicating their switch after losing to rock.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie. They have a tendency to play scissors frequently, which can be countered by playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations. The opponent's strategy is predictable and can be exploited by anticipating their next move based on the outcome of the previous round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they repeat their move after a win. Since they won the last round with 'paper', it is likely they will play 'paper' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent frequently plays scissors, which can be countered by playing rock.
   - The opponent's behavior is not perfectly consistent but follows a general pattern of switching moves after a loss or tie.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - Most hypotheses suggest that the opponent switches their move after a loss or tie and repeats their move after a win.
   - There is a consistent prediction that the opponent will play paper next, and the recommended counter is to play scissors.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - The opponent played paper in the last round and lost to my scissors.
   - Based on the pattern, the opponent is likely to switch their move after this loss.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing scissors has often resulted in positive rewards, especially when predicting the opponent's next move as paper.
   - This suggests that the opponent might have a tendency to play paper after certain conditions, which can be exploited by playing scissors.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie.
   - There is a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.
   - The opponent's strategy is not highly adaptive but follows a predictable pattern that can be countered effectively.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent's strategy suggests they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to their strategy, they will switch their move. Given their frequent inclination towards playing 'scissors', it is likely they will switch to 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {92: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 93: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 61: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Repetition and Switching Patterns**:
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win. For example, in round 44, they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper', then switched to 'paper' in round 45.
   - After a loss, they switch their move. For instance, in round 45, they lost with 'paper' and switched to 'scissors' in round 46.
   - After a tie, they switch their move. For example, in round 86, both played 'paper', and in round 87, they switched to 'rock'.

2. **Frequent Inclination Towards Scissors**:
   - The opponent has shown a frequent inclination towards playing 'scissors'. This is evident from rounds like 46, 51, 58, 66, 71, 76, 82, and 92, where they played 'scissors'.

3. **Exploiting the Opponent's Strategy**:
   - Given the frequent use of 'scissors', playing 'rock' has been beneficial, as seen in rounds 48, 55, 61, 67, 73, 78, 84, and 93, where I played 'rock' and won against their 'scissors'.

4. **Static Strategy or Pattern**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a static strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern can be exploited by predicting their next move based on the outcome of the previous round.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing 'rock' has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent frequently plays 'scissors'. This suggests that the opponent's strategy can be countered effectively by playing 'rock'.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and given that they lost the last round with scissors, they are likely to switch. Since they frequently play scissors, they might switch to rock or paper. However, considering their tendency to switch to rock after losing with scissors, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.29720175709205704, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.29474439300000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: The opponent seems to follow a pattern where they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern has been consistently observed in the hypotheses from rounds 38, 61, 84, 93, and 94.

2. **Frequent Inclination**: The opponent shows a frequent inclination towards playing scissors. This has been noted in multiple hypotheses, suggesting that playing rock could be a beneficial counter-strategy.

3. **Recent Plays**: In the most recent rounds (90-94), the opponent played paper, paper, paper, scissors, rock. After losing with paper in rounds 90 and 91, they switched to scissors in round 92 and then to rock in round 94 after losing with scissors in round 93. This supports the hypothesis that they switch after a loss.

4. **Reward Analysis**: When I play rock, I tend to receive positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors. This suggests that the opponent's frequent inclination towards scissors can be exploited by playing rock.

5. **Consistency of Hypotheses**: The hypotheses have been consistent in predicting the opponent's next play as rock, with my counter being paper. This has been effective in recent rounds, as seen in round 94 where I played paper against their rock and won.

Given these observations, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

- **After a win**: Repeat the move.
- **After a loss**: Switch the move.
- **After a tie**: Switch the move.
- **Frequent inclination**: The opponent often plays scissors, which can be countered by playing rock.

This strategy aligns with the interaction history and previous hypotheses, indicating a reasonable approximation of the opponent's behavior.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they lost the last round (since I played paper and they played rock), they are likely to switch from rock. Given their frequent play of scissors, it is likely they will switch to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.5063210751, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 93: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

Top hypotheses: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.5063210751, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 93: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

To understand the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - **Hypothesis 1 (Round 84):** The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This hypothesis predicted the opponent would play 'paper' next, and suggested I play 'scissors'.
   - **Hypothesis 2 (Round 93):** The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They have a frequent inclination towards playing 'scissors', which can be exploited by playing 'rock'.

2. **Recent Interaction Analysis:**
   - **Round 95:** I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper', and I lost. This suggests the opponent might have repeated their move from the previous round (Round 94) where they played 'rock' and lost, thus switching to 'paper'.

3. **Pattern Observation:**
   - The opponent seems to switch their move after a loss and repeat their move after a win. This aligns with both previous hypotheses.
   - There is a noted inclination towards playing 'scissors', but recent rounds show a pattern of switching moves after losses and repeating after wins.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - When I play 'rock', I have received mixed results, suggesting the opponent's strategy is not static but reactive.
   - Playing 'scissors' has often resulted in a win, especially when predicting the opponent's 'paper'.

5. **Refined Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss. They may also switch after a tie, but this is less clear. The inclination towards 'scissors' is less pronounced in recent rounds, suggesting a more reactive strategy based on the immediate past outcome.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss. They may switch after a tie. Recent rounds show a reactive strategy rather than a static preference for any particular move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'. According to the observed strategy, the opponent tends to repeat their move after a win. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will play 'paper' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. For example, in round 47, they played scissors and lost, then switched to rock in round 48.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. For instance, in round 48, they won with scissors and repeated scissors in round 49.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For example, in round 53, both played rock, resulting in a tie, and the opponent switched to scissors in round 54.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - There is a noted inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.
   - The opponent's strategy appears reactive rather than static, indicating they adjust based on the outcome of the previous round.

3. **Current Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This pattern is consistent with the observed data.
   - The opponent does not show a strong static preference for any particular move, but there is a slight tendency to play scissors, which can be countered by playing rock.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing rock against the opponent's scissors, suggesting a potential static preference for scissors that can be exploited.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's likely policy is to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. They may have a slight preference for playing scissors, which can be countered by playing rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They show a slight tendency to play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch from 'paper'. Given their slight tendency to play 'scissors', they might switch to 'scissors' in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {97: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {97: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They show a slight tendency to play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 61: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.28080198837000003, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.15809732679900002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent tends to play scissors frequently, which has been noted in previous hypotheses.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

2. **Recent Plays**:
   - In round 97, the opponent played scissors and lost to my rock.
   - In round 96, the opponent played paper and lost to my scissors.
   - In round 95, the opponent played paper and won against my rock.
   - In round 94, the opponent played rock and lost to my paper.
   - In round 93, the opponent played scissors and lost to my rock.

3. **Hypothesis Evaluation**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play scissors, which aligns with the previous hypotheses.
   - The opponent switches their move after a loss, as seen in rounds 96 and 94.
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win, as seen in round 95.

4. **Static Strategy Consideration**:
   - Given the frequent occurrence of scissors, the opponent might be using a strategy that favors scissors, which can be exploited by consistently playing rock.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially against the opponent's frequent scissors plays.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

This hypothesis suggests that consistently playing rock could be an effective counter-strategy, given the opponent's tendency to play scissors and their behavior of switching moves after a loss or tie.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie, and considering that they lost the last round (they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to switch from scissors. Given their frequent inclination towards playing scissors, they might switch to rock or paper. However, since they often play scissors, they might switch to rock to counter my rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's potential switch to rock, my best move would be to play paper, as it beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.256551, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win. This is evident from rounds where they won, such as round 50 (opponent played paper after winning with paper in round 49).
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move. For example, in round 51, after losing with paper, they switched to scissors.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For instance, in round 86, after a tie with paper, they switched to rock in round 87.

2. **Inclination Towards Scissors**:
   - The opponent shows a frequent inclination towards playing scissors. This is supported by the fact that they have played scissors multiple times, and it has been noted in previous hypotheses.

3. **Exploitation Strategy**:
   - Given the opponent's tendency to repeat moves after a win and switch after a loss or tie, and their inclination towards scissors, playing rock can be a beneficial strategy. Rock beats scissors and ties with rock, which the opponent is predicted to play after a loss or tie.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When playing rock, I have received positive rewards frequently, especially when the opponent plays scissors. This supports the hypothesis that the opponent has a tendency to play scissors.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie, and considering they lost the last round (they played rock against my paper), they are likely to switch. Since they have shown a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, it is likely they will switch to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.58746769013151, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 93: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.4795857, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 97: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They show a slight tendency to play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.05700000000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they seem to repeat their move. For example:
   - Round 50: Opponent played paper and won, repeated paper in round 51.
   - Round 63: Opponent played paper and won, repeated paper in round 64.
   - Round 95: Opponent played paper and won, repeated paper in round 96.

2. **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they switch their move. For example:
   - Round 51: Opponent played paper and lost, switched to scissors in round 52.
   - Round 55: Opponent played scissors and lost, switched to rock in round 56.
   - Round 67: Opponent played scissors and lost, switched to rock in round 68.

3. **Ties**: When the opponent ties, they switch their move. For example:
   - Round 53: Opponent played rock and tied, switched to scissors in round 54.
   - Round 86: Opponent played paper and tied, switched to rock in round 87.
   - Round 87: Opponent played rock and tied, switched to scissors in round 88.

From this analysis, it appears that the opponent's strategy is consistent with the following pattern:
- After a win, they repeat their move.
- After a loss, they switch their move.
- After a tie, they switch their move.

This hypothesis aligns well with the observed data and previous hypotheses. The opponent's frequent inclination towards playing paper can be exploited by playing scissors, as this would counter their tendency to repeat winning moves.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move. They show a frequent inclination towards playing paper, which can be exploited by playing scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent's strategy suggests that after a win, they repeat their move. In the last round, they played paper and won. Therefore, it is likely that they will play paper again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be to play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.19785916816443994, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 93: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.14499699300000007, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.19785916816443994, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 93: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.14499699300000007, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - **Hypothesis 1 (Round 84):** The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. Predicted next play was 'rock'.
   - **Hypothesis 2 (Round 93):** The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They have a tendency to play 'scissors', which can be countered by playing 'rock'. Predicted next play was 'paper'.

2. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has shown a pattern of playing 'scissors' frequently, especially after certain rounds where they won or tied.
   - When I played 'paper', the opponent often responded with 'scissors', indicating a possible tendency to counter 'paper' with 'scissors'.
   - When I played 'rock', the opponent sometimes responded with 'paper', but there were also instances where they played 'scissors', which I won against.

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play 'scissors' after I play 'paper', which suggests they might be trying to counter 'paper' specifically.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays 'scissors' after winning or tying, which aligns with the previous hypotheses.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent likely follows a strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie.
   - They show a frequent inclination towards playing 'scissors', especially after I play 'paper'.

5. **Strategy for Countering:**
   - Given the opponent's tendency to play 'scissors', especially after I play 'paper', I should consider playing 'rock' more frequently to counter their 'scissors' plays.
   - This aligns with the previous hypothesis that suggested exploiting their inclination towards 'scissors' by playing 'rock'.

Based on this analysis, I will refine the hypothesis as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and given that they won the last round with scissors, it is likely that they will repeat their move and play scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.438501417715108, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 93: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent tends to play scissors frequently, especially after I play paper. This is evident from the rounds where I played paper, and the opponent responded with scissors.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. This is observed in rounds where they won, and their subsequent move was the same.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move. This is consistent with the rounds where they lost, and their next move was different.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. This pattern is also seen in rounds that ended in a tie.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - There is a noted tendency for the opponent to play scissors, which has been exploited by playing rock.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing rock has yielded positive rewards frequently, especially when the opponent plays scissors. This suggests that the opponent has a tendency to play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating moves after a win and switching after a loss or tie. They have a notable inclination towards playing scissors, particularly after I play paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's likely policy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

This hypothesis aligns with the observed data and previous hypotheses, suggesting a consistent pattern in the opponent's strategy.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they lost the last round when they played scissors against my rock, they are likely to switch from scissors. Given their tendency to play scissors after I play paper, they might switch to rock or paper. However, since they lost with scissors, they are more likely to switch to rock to counter my previous rock play.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.6069509924005756, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 103: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 38: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

                ```python

                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

Top hypotheses: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.6069509924005756, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 103: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - **Hypothesis 1 (Round 84):** The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This hypothesis had a high value of 0.6069, suggesting it was a strong fit at that time.
   - **Hypothesis 2 (Round 103):** The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock. This hypothesis had a lower value of 0.3, indicating less confidence.
   - **Hypothesis 3 (Round 38):** Similar to Hypothesis 1, but with a lower confidence value of 0.2356.

2. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent seems to switch their move after a loss, as seen in several rounds where they lost and changed their play.
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their move, which aligns with the hypotheses.
   - After a tie, the opponent also switches their move, which is consistent with the hypotheses.

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating moves after a win and switching after a loss or tie.
   - There is a noted tendency for the opponent to play scissors after I play paper, which suggests a potential bias or pattern that can be exploited.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - When I play rock, I tend to get positive rewards, especially when predicting the opponent's play as scissors or rock.
   - Playing paper has also yielded positive rewards when predicting the opponent's play as rock.

Based on the above analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

This hypothesis suggests that by anticipating the opponent's tendency to switch moves after a loss or tie, and their bias towards playing scissors after I play paper, I can effectively counter their strategy by playing rock more frequently.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. In the last round, the opponent played rock and lost. According to their strategy, they will switch their play. Since they have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, it is likely they will switch to scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.7248656946804029, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. According to the strategy, they will repeat their move after a win. Therefore, the predicted opponent's next play is 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round, my best counter move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.26518419039339736, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 102: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.26518419039339736, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 102: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.026129999999999987, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - **Hypothesis 1 (Round 84):** After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move. Predicted next play was 'rock'.
   - **Hypothesis 2 (Round 102):** The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They tend to play scissors, especially after I play paper. Predicted next play was 'paper'.

2. **Recent Interaction Analysis:**
   - **Round 105:** I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won. Next round (106), opponent played scissors.
   - **Round 106:** I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost.

3. **Pattern Observation:**
   - When I win (e.g., round 105), the opponent tends to switch their move (from paper to scissors in round 106).
   - When I lose (e.g., round 106), the opponent tends to repeat their move (scissors in round 106 after winning in round 105).

4. **Strategy Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent seems to switch their move after a loss and repeat their move after a win. This aligns with the previous hypotheses, especially the one from Round 84.

5. **Reward Analysis:**
   - I tend to get positive rewards when playing rock against their scissors, which suggests they might play scissors frequently after I play paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy appears to be:
- **After a win:** Repeat the move.
- **After a loss:** Switch the move.
- **After a tie:** Switch the move.

This strategy aligns with the previous hypothesis from Round 84 and explains the recent plays.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing, they switch their move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and won, so they are likely to repeat their move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', my best move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.48562893327537815, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 107: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 104: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To understand the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. For example, when they played scissors and lost to my rock, they switched to paper in the next round.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. For instance, when they won with scissors against my paper, they played scissors again.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. This is evident from rounds where ties occurred, and the opponent changed their move in the subsequent round.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The consistent prediction across multiple rounds is that the opponent switches their move after a loss or tie and repeats after a win.
   - There is a noted tendency for the opponent to play scissors, especially after I play paper.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - This suggests that the opponent's strategy can be exploited by frequently playing rock, as they have a tendency to play scissors.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be: switch after a loss or tie, repeat after a win, with a frequent inclination towards playing scissors.
   - This hypothesis aligns well with the observed data, as playing rock has been successful against their frequent scissors plays.

Given this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and frequently plays scissors, especially after I play paper. This can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss or tie, and frequently playing scissors, especially after I play paper, I predict their next move will be rock. This is because they lost the last round when they played scissors against my rock, so they are likely to switch to rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. For example, when they played rock and lost to my paper, they switched to scissors in the next round.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. For instance, when they won with paper against my rock, they played paper again.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. This is observed when both played the same move, and the opponent changed their move in the next round.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The consistent theme across hypotheses is that the opponent switches after a loss or tie and repeats after a win.
   - There is a noted tendency for the opponent to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which suggests a pattern that can be exploited by playing rock.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have been receiving positive rewards when playing paper against their rock, indicating a pattern where they might frequently play rock after certain conditions.
   - Playing rock has also yielded positive rewards when the opponent plays scissors.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: "After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper."

Given this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations and can be used to inform my strategy moving forward.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round where they played rock against my paper, they are likely to switch their move. Given their tendency to play scissors after I play paper, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted scissors play by the opponent, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.7479581773049353, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and won. Therefore, it is likely that they will play 'paper' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.27649950687941827, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 107: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

Top hypotheses: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.27649950687941827, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 107: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.23193000000000008, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 38: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.1906744895201234, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - After a win (e.g., round 63, 65, 68, 70, 72, 75, 77, 79, 81, 83, 90, 91, 95, 99, 101, 104, 106, 109, 111), the opponent seems to switch their move.
   - After a loss (e.g., round 62, 64, 66, 67, 69, 71, 73, 74, 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 92, 93, 94, 96, 97, 98, 100, 102, 103, 105, 107, 108, 110), the opponent seems to switch their move.
   - After a tie (e.g., round 86, 87, 88, 89), the opponent switches their move.

2. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be consistent with the hypothesis: "After a win, the opponent switches their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move."
   - This pattern is consistent with the previous hypotheses and seems to explain the data observed so far.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When playing paper, I have received both positive and negative rewards, indicating that the opponent is not playing a static strategy that can be easily exploited by consistently playing paper.
   - The opponent's strategy involves switching moves, making it challenging to exploit with a single static counter-strategy.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent switches their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after every round, and considering they played 'scissors' last, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock', my next play should be 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.49354965481559276, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 107: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

To determine my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move.
   - After a loss or tie, the opponent tends to switch their move.

2. **Patterns Observed**:
   - When I play paper and lose, the opponent often plays scissors.
   - When I play rock and win, the opponent sometimes switches to paper.
   - When I play scissors and win, the opponent sometimes repeats their previous move.

3. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - The opponent shows a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

4. **Current Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be: after a win, repeat the move; after a loss or tie, switch the move. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper.

5. **Strategy Evaluation**:
   - Playing rock has often resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent tends to play scissors.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie aligns well with the observed data.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit the opponent's tendency to play scissors by playing rock, especially after I play paper and lose.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they tend to repeat their move. Since they won the last round with scissors, it is likely they will play scissors again.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, I should play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. For example, when they played 'scissors' and lost to my 'rock', they switched to 'rock' in the next round.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. For instance, when they won with 'paper' against my 'rock', they played 'paper' again in the following round.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. This is evident from the rounds where both players played the same move, resulting in a tie, and the opponent switched in the next round.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The most consistent hypothesis is that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This aligns with the observed behavior in the interaction history.
   - The opponent has a tendency to play 'scissors', especially after I play 'paper'. This can be exploited by playing 'rock'.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing 'rock' has consistently given positive rewards, especially when the opponent tends to play 'scissors'.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be: repeat the move after a win, switch after a loss or tie, with a frequent inclination towards playing 'scissors'. This can be effectively countered by playing 'rock'.

Based on the analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie, and considering they played 'scissors' and lost in the last round, they are likely to switch. Given their frequent inclination towards playing 'scissors', they might switch to 'rock' or 'paper'. However, since they lost with 'scissors', they might switch to 'rock' to counter my 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely switch to 'rock', my best play would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.7518393308596404, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their strategy, they are likely to switch from 'rock' to 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.2784012721212239, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.2784012721212239, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. For instance, in rounds 68 and 69, the opponent played 'rock' after winning with 'rock' in round 68.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move. For example, in round 67, they played 'scissors' and lost, then switched to 'rock' in round 68.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. In rounds 86, 87, and 88, the opponent switched from 'paper' to 'rock' to 'scissors' after ties.

2. **Static Strategy Check**:
   - When I play 'rock', I have a mix of wins and losses, indicating no consistent advantage.
   - When I play 'paper', I have a mix of wins and losses, again indicating no consistent advantage.
   - When I play 'scissors', I have a mix of wins and losses, suggesting no static strategy from the opponent.

3. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be: after a win, repeat the move; after a loss, switch the move; after a tie, switch the move. This aligns with the previous hypothesis and the observed data.

4. **Strategy Implication**:
   - To exploit this, I should anticipate the opponent's next move based on their last result and choose the counter move accordingly.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis remains consistent with the previous one. The opponent's strategy is predictable based on their last result.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted scissors play, my next move should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.49488089048485673, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 117: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 113: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 38: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to play scissors frequently, especially after I play paper.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches their move.
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their move.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent's strategy has been consistently described as switching moves after a loss or tie and repeating after a win.
   - There is a noted tendency for the opponent to favor scissors, particularly after I play paper.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's frequent play of scissors suggests a potential bias or static strategy that can be exploited.
   - My strategy of playing rock has been yielding positive rewards, indicating that the opponent's strategy is predictable and exploitable.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a strategy where they switch moves after a loss or tie and repeat after a win. They have a noticeable tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper. This pattern allows me to exploit their strategy by frequently playing rock, which counters their inclination towards scissors.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is that the opponent's strategy involves switching moves after a loss or tie, repeating after a win, and having a tendency to play scissors, particularly after I play paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches moves after a loss or tie and repeats after a win. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of switching moves after a loss or tie and repeating after a win, and considering they lost the last round when I played rock, they are likely to switch from scissors. Given their tendency to play scissors after I play paper, they might choose rock to counter my potential paper play.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {

                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. For example, when they played rock and lost to my paper, they switched to paper in the next round.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. For instance, when they won with paper against my rock, they played paper again.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. This is evident from rounds where both played the same move and the opponent switched in the subsequent round.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The consistent theme across previous hypotheses is that the opponent switches after a loss or tie and repeats after a win.
   - There is a noted tendency for the opponent to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch after a tie or loss.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have been receiving positive rewards when playing paper against their rock, indicating a potential pattern or weakness in their strategy that can be exploited.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: "After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be predictable and can be exploited by anticipating their next move based on the outcome of the previous round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round where they played rock against my paper, they are likely to switch their move. Given their tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.7524916363375799, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be 'paper' again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they switch their move. In the last round, both of us played paper, resulting in a tie. Therefore, according to their strategy, the opponent is likely to switch from paper to scissors in the next round.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: The consistent hypothesis across different rounds is that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This hypothesis has been repeated multiple times with varying confidence levels.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: When the opponent loses (e.g., when I play rock and they play scissors), they tend to switch their move in the next round.
   - **Losses**: When the opponent wins (e.g., when I play rock and they play paper), they tend to repeat their move in the next round.
   - **Ties**: When there is a tie (e.g., both play rock), they tend to switch their move in the next round.

3. **Static Strategy Check**: 
   - When I play rock, I often win against scissors, lose against paper, and tie against rock. This suggests that the opponent is not playing a static strategy like always playing rock, paper, or scissors.

4. **Pattern Consistency**: The opponent's behavior seems to align with the hypothesis that they switch after a loss or tie and repeat after a win. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

5. **Reward Analysis**: 
   - Positive rewards are often obtained when I play rock against scissors or paper against rock, indicating that the opponent switches their move after a loss.

Based on this analysis, the most consistent hypothesis is that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This hypothesis explains the data observed so far reasonably well.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they switch their move. In the last round, both of us played rock, resulting in a tie. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will switch from rock to paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round, my best counter-move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.12128226137822423, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 84: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.04657324188465295, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - **Hypothesis 1 (Round 34)**: The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This hypothesis predicted the opponent would play "scissors" next.
   - **Hypothesis 2 (Round 84)**: After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move. This hypothesis predicted the opponent would play "paper" next.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: The opponent often repeats their move after a win. For example, in rounds 74 (opponent played "rock" and lost), 75 (opponent played "paper" and won), and 76 (opponent played "paper" and lost), the opponent switched after a loss and repeated after a win.
   - **Losses**: The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. This is consistent with rounds 75 to 76 and 77 to 78.
   - **Ties**: The opponent appears to switch their move after a tie. For example, in rounds 86 (tie with "paper") to 87 (opponent switched to "rock").

3. **Current Round (123)**: The last round was a tie with both playing "scissors". According to the hypothesis, the opponent should switch their move.

4. **Pattern Consistency**: The opponent's behavior aligns well with the hypothesis that they repeat after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern is consistent across multiple rounds.

5. **Static Strategy Check**: There is no indication that the opponent is playing a static strategy, as they switch moves based on the outcome of the previous round.

6. **Reward Analysis**: When playing "rock", I have received positive rewards frequently, especially when the opponent switches to "scissors" after a tie or loss.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after a tie, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {117: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.22835199000000006, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 48: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {117: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.22835199000000006, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 48: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.1596938533902863, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: Both previous hypotheses suggest that the opponent follows a strategy where:
   - After a win, the opponent repeats their move.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: When the opponent wins (e.g., round 75, 81, 90, 95, 99, 104, 109, 119), they played paper against my rock. In the subsequent rounds, they switched their move to scissors or rock, which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch after a win.
   - **Losses**: When the opponent loses (e.g., round 76, 78, 80, 82, 84, 92, 93, 96, 97, 100, 102, 105, 107, 110, 113, 115, 117, 120), they played paper or rock against my scissors or rock. In the subsequent rounds, they switched their move, which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch after a loss.
   - **Ties**: When there is a tie (e.g., round 86, 87, 88, 89, 121, 122, 123, 124), the opponent played the same move as me. In the subsequent rounds, they switched their move, which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch after a tie.

3. **Static Strategy Check**: There is no evidence of a static strategy as the opponent's moves vary based on the outcome of the previous round.

4. **Reward Analysis**: I have received positive rewards when playing scissors against paper and rock against scissors, which suggests that the opponent's strategy can be exploited by predicting their next move based on the outcome of the previous round.

Based on the analysis, the previous hypothesis seems to explain the opponent's behavior well. Therefore, I will continue to use this hypothesis to inform my strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they switch their move. In the last round, both of us played paper, resulting in a tie. Therefore, I predict the opponent will switch from paper to rock in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {117: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.459846393, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 125: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. For example, when they played rock and lost to paper, they switched to scissors.
   - After a win, the opponent repeats their move. For instance, when they won with scissors against paper, they played scissors again.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For example, when both played paper, the opponent switched to rock.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.
   - The predicted opponent's next play has often been rock, with the recommended counter being paper.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing paper has often resulted in positive rewards, especially when predicting the opponent's play as rock.
   - This suggests that the opponent might have a tendency to play rock more frequently after certain conditions, such as losing to paper or after ties.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be: repeat the move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern aligns with the previous hypotheses and the observed interaction history.
   - Given the consistent success of playing paper, it seems the opponent might have a slight bias towards playing rock, especially after ties or losses to paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move. The opponent shows a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper or after ties.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing to paper, they are likely to switch their move. Given their slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {117: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.6218924751, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 125: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.40459981565273095, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 48: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.16824998816124026, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has shown a pattern of switching moves after ties and losses, and repeating moves after wins. This is evident from the rounds where ties and losses led to a change in their play, while wins often resulted in the same play being repeated.
   - For example, in round 125, the opponent played 'rock' after a tie in round 124 with 'paper', which aligns with the hypothesis of switching after a tie.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The consistent hypothesis across multiple rounds is: "After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move."
   - This hypothesis has been supported by the interaction history, with a relatively high confidence value (e.g., 0.6218924751 in round 117).

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When playing 'scissors', I have often received positive rewards, especially when the opponent's predicted next play was 'paper'. This suggests that the opponent's strategy can be exploited by playing 'scissors' when 'paper' is predicted.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The hypothesis that the opponent switches after ties and losses, and repeats after wins, explains the data well. This strategy can be countered by predicting their next move based on the outcome of the previous round and playing the counter move.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to use the hypothesis that the opponent switches after ties and losses, and repeats after wins, to inform my strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after a tie, and since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, I predict the opponent will switch from paper to scissors in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.73532473257, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they switch their move. In the last round, both of us played rock, resulting in a tie. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to switch from rock to paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter-move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the hypotheses generated so far.

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a tie. For example, in rounds 86-87, 88-89, 121-122, 123-124, and 126-127, the opponent switched their move after a tie.
   - The opponent seems to switch their move after a loss. For instance, in rounds 79-80, 81-82, 83-84, 95-96, 99-100, 104-105, 109-110, 112-113, and 116-117, the opponent switched their move after losing.
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win. This is observed in rounds 80-81, 82-83, 84-85, 85-86, 92-93, 93-94, 94-95, 96-97, 97-98, 98-99, 100-101, 102-103, 103-104, 105-106, 107-108, 108-109, 110-111, 113-114, 114-115, 115-116, 117-118, 118-119, and 120-121.

2. **Hypotheses Evaluation**:
   - The hypothesis that the opponent switches after a loss and a tie, and repeats after a win, aligns well with the observed data.
   - The previous hypotheses consistently predicted the opponent's next move based on this pattern, and the predictions have been accurate.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When playing "paper," I have generally received positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays "rock" after switching from a loss or tie.
   - Playing "scissors" has also been effective when predicting the opponent will play "paper" after switching from a loss or tie.

Given the consistency of the opponent's behavior with the hypothesis, it seems that the opponent is following a strategy where they repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. This strategy has been observed consistently throughout the rounds.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to use the hypothesis to predict the opponent's next move and choose my play accordingly.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they switch their move. In the last round, both played scissors, resulting in a tie. Therefore, the opponent is likely to switch from scissors to rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {117: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.4503091189592999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python

                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {117: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.4503091189592999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **After a Win**: 
   - When the opponent wins, they seem to switch their move. For example, in round 81, they played 'paper' and won against my 'rock'. In the next round (82), they switched to 'paper' again, which doesn't fit the pattern. However, in round 83, they played 'scissors' after winning with 'paper' in round 82. This suggests a possible switch after a win.

2. **After a Loss**:
   - When the opponent loses, they seem to switch their move. For instance, in round 80, they lost with 'rock' against my 'paper', and in round 81, they switched to 'paper'. This pattern is consistent in other rounds as well.

3. **After a Tie**:
   - After a tie, the opponent seems to switch their move. For example, in round 86, both played 'paper', resulting in a tie. In the next round (87), they switched to 'rock'.

4. **Static Strategy**:
   - The opponent does not appear to be playing a static strategy, as they change their moves based on the outcome of the previous round.

5. **Pattern Consistency**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be consistent with the hypothesis that they switch their move after a win, loss, or tie. This aligns with the previous hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent switches their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

This hypothesis suggests that the opponent is likely to change their move regardless of the previous round's outcome, which can be exploited by predicting their next move based on this pattern.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent switches their move after every round, and the last play was 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent's plays in the last few rounds have been: rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, rock.
   - When the opponent lost, they switched their move (e.g., from rock to paper, paper to scissors).
   - When the opponent tied, they also switched their move (e.g., from paper to rock).
   - When the opponent won, they switched their move (e.g., from scissors to paper).

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The most recent hypothesis suggests that the opponent switches their move after every outcome (win, loss, tie).
   - This hypothesis has been consistent with the observed data, as the opponent has been switching moves regardless of the result.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - When I play paper, I often receive a positive reward, especially when the opponent plays rock.
   - This suggests that the opponent has a tendency to play rock after certain outcomes, which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch moves.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent seems to follow a strategy where they switch their move after every round, regardless of the outcome. This pattern has been consistent in the recent rounds and aligns with the previous hypothesis.

Given this analysis, I will continue to exploit this pattern by predicting the opponent's next move based on their tendency to switch moves.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches their move after every round, regardless of the outcome.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after every round, and considering their last play was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.40013109101675454, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 117: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.015216383271509926, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.40013109101675454, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 117: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.015216383271509926, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: 
   - Both hypotheses suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern seems to be consistent with the interaction history.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their move. For example, in round 83, the opponent played scissors after winning with scissors in round 82.
   - **Losses**: After a loss, the opponent switches their move. For instance, in round 84, the opponent played scissors after losing with paper in round 83.
   - **Ties**: After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For example, in round 86, the opponent played rock after tying with paper in round 85.

3. **Static Strategy Check**:
   - There is no clear pattern of the opponent playing a static strategy like always playing rock, paper, or scissors. The opponent seems to be following a dynamic strategy based on the outcome of the previous round.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play rock, I tend to get positive rewards when the opponent plays scissors, which aligns with the hypothesis that the opponent switches to scissors after a tie or loss.

Given this analysis, the previous hypotheses still hold true and explain the opponent's behavior well. The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to switch their play. Since they played scissors last, they might switch to rock or paper. Given the pattern observed in previous ties, they are more likely to switch to rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {130: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent switches their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 125: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.17249199000000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {130: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent switches their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 125: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.17249199000000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent's plays have been a mix of rock, paper, and scissors.
   - There are several instances where ties occur, suggesting the opponent might be repeating their previous move or switching based on a pattern.
   - The opponent's responses after wins, losses, and ties need to be examined to identify any consistent behavior.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - **Hypothesis at Round 130:** The opponent switches their move after a win, loss, or tie. This hypothesis predicted the opponent would play paper next, which matched the actual play in round 132.
   - **Hypothesis at Round 125:** The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This hypothesis also predicted the opponent would play paper next, which was correct.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - The opponent played paper in round 132 after a tie in round 131 (scissors vs. scissors).
   - The opponent's behavior seems consistent with switching moves after a tie, as seen in the recent rounds.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - Given the consistent prediction of the opponent's next move as paper, the hypothesis that the opponent switches their move after a tie seems to hold.
   - The opponent might be employing a strategy where they switch moves after ties and possibly after losses, while repeating after wins.

5. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing paper has resulted in ties or wins against rock.
   - Playing scissors against predicted paper has been beneficial, suggesting the opponent's tendency to play paper after certain conditions.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting hypothesis is that the opponent switches their move after a tie and possibly after a loss, while repeating after a win.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they switch their move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing paper, the opponent is likely to switch from paper to scissors in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move is to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to switch moves after ties, as seen in rounds 86-87, 88-89, 122-123, 127-128, and 132-133.
   - After losses, the opponent also tends to switch moves, as seen in rounds 90-91, 95-96, 99-100, 104-105, 109-110, 119-120.
   - After wins, the opponent has repeated their move in some instances, such as rounds 84-85, 92-93, 93-94, 102-103, 107-108, 113-114.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The most recent hypotheses suggest that the opponent switches their move after a tie and a loss, and sometimes repeats their move after a win.
   - The hypothesis from round 130 suggests that the opponent switches their move after every outcome, which aligns with the observed behavior in ties and losses but not consistently after wins.

3. **Current Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent seems to switch their move after a tie and a loss, and occasionally repeats their move after a win. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When playing rock, I have received positive rewards when the opponent played scissors, but ties occurred when the opponent also played rock.
   - Playing paper has generally resulted in positive rewards when the opponent played rock.
   - Playing scissors has resulted in positive rewards when the opponent played paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches their move after a tie and a loss, and occasionally repeats their move after a win.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of switching their move after a tie, and given that the last round was a tie with both playing rock, it is likely that the opponent will switch from rock to paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {130: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent switches their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.026129999999999987, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the previous hypothesis:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent switches their move after every outcome (win, loss, tie). The predicted next play was 'paper', and my next play was 'scissors'.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: When I played 'paper' against 'rock', I won. The opponent switched to 'paper' or 'scissors' in the next round.
   - **Losses**: When I played 'rock' against 'paper', I lost. The opponent switched to 'scissors' or 'rock' in the next round.
   - **Ties**: When both played the same move, the opponent switched their move in the next round.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to switch their move after every round, regardless of the outcome. This aligns with the previous hypothesis.

4. **Static Strategy Check**:
   - There is no evidence of a static strategy since the opponent changes their move after every round.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I anticipate the opponent's switch and play the counter move.

Based on the above analysis, the previous hypothesis still holds true. The opponent switches their move after every round, regardless of the outcome. This strategy can be exploited by predicting the opponent's next move and playing the counter move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After every round, the opponent switches their move regardless of the outcome.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after every round, and considering that they played 'scissors' in the last round, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and evaluate the hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has shown a pattern of repeating their move after a tie, as seen in rounds 86-87, 88-89, 121-122, 126-127, 128-129, 132-133, and 134-135.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move, as seen in rounds 90-91, 95-96, 99-100, 104-105, 109-110, and 119-120.
   - After a win, the opponent repeats their move, as seen in rounds 92-93, 93-94, 96-97, 97-98, 102-103, 103-104, 105-106, 107-108, 110-111, 113-114, 115-116, 117-118, and 118-119.

2. **Hypotheses Evaluation:**
   - The hypothesis from round 125, which states that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie, aligns well with the observed behavior.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be consistent with this hypothesis, as they have shown a tendency to repeat moves after a win and switch after a loss or tie.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - When playing the same move as the opponent (resulting in a tie), the reward is consistently 0.
   - Playing scissors against the predicted paper move of the opponent has resulted in positive rewards in the past.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows: they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern is consistent and can be exploited by predicting their next move and playing the counter strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they switch their move. In the last round, both of us played paper, resulting in a tie. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will switch from paper to scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my best counter-move is to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {130: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent switches their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.5228037, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 125: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.5073153267989999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.11282088852347999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has shown a pattern of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie. This is evident from rounds where ties occurred, and the opponent switched their move in the subsequent round.
   - The opponent's move after a loss also indicates a switch, as seen in rounds where I won, and they changed their move in the next round.
   - The opponent's behavior after a win is less clear due to fewer instances, but there are indications of them repeating their move.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The most consistent hypothesis is that the opponent switches their move after a tie and a loss, and repeats their move after a win. This hypothesis has been supported by the interaction history and has a relatively high value of confidence.

3. **Static Strategy Consideration:**
   - When I play rock, the opponent often plays rock, leading to ties. This suggests that the opponent might be inclined to play rock frequently, but the pattern of switching after ties and losses is more prominent.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing rock has resulted in several ties, indicating that the opponent often plays rock. However, playing scissors and paper has yielded positive rewards when the opponent switches their move after a loss or tie.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's likely strategy is to repeat their move after a win and switch their move after a loss or tie. This aligns with the previous hypothesis that has been most consistent with the observed data.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they switch their move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {125: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.6551207287592999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has shown a pattern of repeating moves after ties, as seen in rounds 88-89, 123-124, 128-129, 131-132, and 134-135.
   - After losses, the opponent tends to switch moves, as observed in rounds 90-91 and 101-102.
   - After wins, the opponent seems to repeat their move, as seen in rounds 92-93 and 94-95.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The most consistent hypothesis suggests that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This hypothesis aligns well with the observed data.
   - The hypothesis with a value of 0.6551207287592999 is particularly consistent with the interaction history, predicting the opponent's next play accurately in several instances.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - When I play rock, I tend to get positive rewards when the opponent plays scissors, which aligns with the hypothesis that they might switch to scissors after a tie or loss.
   - Playing scissors has resulted in ties frequently, indicating the opponent's tendency to repeat scissors after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's likely strategy is to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This strategy is consistent with the observed data and previous hypotheses.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after a tie, and the last round being a tie with both playing scissors, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {130: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent switches their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.346173813, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 125: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has shown a pattern of repeating moves after ties (e.g., rounds 121-122, 124-125, 126-127, 128-129, 132-133, 134-135, 136-137, 138).
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move (e.g., rounds 125-126, 130-131).
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move (e.g., rounds 90-91, 95-96, 99-100, 104-105, 109-110, 119-120).

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The most recent hypothesis (round 130) suggests that the opponent switches their move after every outcome (win, loss, tie). However, this doesn't align perfectly with the observed data, especially after wins and ties.
   - Earlier hypotheses (rounds 125 and 84) suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This aligns more closely with the observed behavior.

3. **Refinement of Hypothesis:**
   - Given the consistent pattern of repeating moves after ties and wins, and switching after losses, the hypothesis from round 125 seems to be the most accurate.
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: "After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent repeats their move."

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - When playing the same choice (e.g., paper), the rewards have been mixed, with ties being common. However, exploiting the pattern of the opponent repeating moves after ties and wins can be beneficial.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely to be:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent repeats their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they are likely to repeat their move. Since the last round ended in a tie with both playing paper, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of paper, my best move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and the previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has a tendency to switch moves frequently, as seen in the rounds where they played different moves after ties and losses.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win, but this is not consistent.
   - The opponent's behavior after ties is predominantly to switch moves.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The most recent hypothesis suggests that the opponent switches their move after every outcome (win, loss, tie). This hypothesis has a relatively high value of 0.5423216691.
   - Another hypothesis suggests the opponent repeats their move after a win but switches after a loss or tie, with a value of 0.411009157092057.

3. **Current Observations**:
   - In the recent rounds, the opponent has shown a pattern of switching moves after ties and losses, which aligns with the first hypothesis.
   - The opponent's behavior is not perfectly consistent, but the tendency to switch moves is evident.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The hypothesis that the opponent switches their move after every outcome (win, loss, tie) seems to explain the observed data well.
   - This strategy would mean that the opponent is unpredictable in terms of repeating moves, but predictable in their tendency to switch moves.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's likely strategy is to switch their move after every outcome. This understanding can be used to anticipate their next move and choose a counter strategy accordingly.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches their move after every outcome (win, loss, tie).'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after every outcome, and considering they won the last round with rock, I predict they will switch to paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played "rock" in the last two rounds, both resulting in a win for them against my "scissors".
   - Prior to these rounds, there were several ties and losses for the opponent, where they played "rock", "paper", and "scissors" in a seemingly random order.
   - The opponent's behavior after a win seems to be consistent with repeating their move, as they played "rock" again after winning with it.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The most consistent hypothesis suggests that after a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or a tie, they switch their move.
   - This hypothesis has been supported by a relatively high value (e.g., 0.5877064099644399), indicating that it explains the opponent's behavior well.

3. **Current Observations**:
   - The opponent's recent plays align with the hypothesis that they repeat their move after a win. This is evident from the repeated "rock" plays after winning against "scissors".
   - There is no clear pattern of switching moves after a loss or tie in the recent rounds, but the hypothesis remains a reasonable approximation.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing "scissors" has resulted in negative rewards in the last two rounds, indicating that the opponent's repeated "rock" plays are effective against it.
   - Playing "paper" against the predicted "rock" would yield positive rewards, supporting the hypothesis.

**Conclusion**:
The opponent likely follows a strategy where they repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. This strategy is not perfectly consistent but explains the observed data well. To counter this, I should play "paper" in the next round, anticipating the opponent's repeated "rock".

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. Since they won the last round with 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted 'rock', my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, it is likely that they will switch from 'rock' to 'paper' in the next round.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.7979761408825755, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, according to their strategy, they are likely to switch from 'paper' to 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round, my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {125: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.2585832986178028, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {125: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.2585832986178028, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Wins, Losses, and Ties:**
   - The opponent seems to switch their move after a loss. For example, when they played rock and lost to paper, they switched to paper in the next round.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. For instance, when they won with scissors against paper, they played scissors again in the next round.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For example, after a tie with paper, they switched to rock.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be consistent with the hypothesis: "After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move."
   - This pattern is evident in multiple instances throughout the interaction history.

3. **Static Strategy or Adaptive?**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be more of a static pattern rather than an adaptive one. They follow a predictable sequence based on the outcome of the previous round.

4. **Exploiting the Strategy:**
   - Given this pattern, we can predict the opponent's next move based on the outcome of the last round. If they won, expect the same move; if they lost or tied, expect a different move.

5. **Positive or Negative Reward:**
   - When playing paper, I have received both positive and negative rewards, indicating that the opponent's strategy is not static but rather outcome-dependent.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations. The opponent's strategy can be exploited by anticipating their next move based on the outcome of the previous round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after they win, they repeat their move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: 
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. For example, in round 95, they played paper and lost to my rock, then switched to paper in round 96.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. For instance, in round 99, they won with paper against my rock and played paper again in round 100.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. This is evident in rounds 121-122, where both played paper, resulting in a tie, and the opponent switched to rock in round 122.

2. **Consistency with Hypotheses**:
   - The previous hypotheses suggest that the opponent switches after a loss or tie and repeats after a win. This pattern is consistent with the observed data.
   - The opponent has a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.

3. **Static Strategy Consideration**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of reactive and static elements. They follow a predictable pattern based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - My positive rewards when playing rock suggest that the opponent's strategy can be countered effectively by playing rock, especially when predicting scissors.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: "After a win, repeat the move. After a loss or tie, switch the move."
   - This strategy is not perfectly consistent but provides a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be effectively countered by anticipating their next move based on the outcome of the previous round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch their move. Given their tendency to play scissors after I play paper, they might switch to rock to counter my potential paper play.

2. 'my_next_play': Since the opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper to counter their move and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and the previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. For example, when they played rock and lost to my paper, they switched to scissors in the next round.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. For instance, when they won with rock against my scissors, they played rock again.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. This is evident from the rounds where both players played the same move, and the opponent switched in the next round.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The consistent theme across the hypotheses is that the opponent switches their move after a loss or a tie and repeats their move after a win.
   - The opponent has a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have been getting positive rewards when playing paper against their rock, which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch to rock after losing with scissors.
   - The pattern of switching after a loss or tie and repeating after a win is consistent with the observed data.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: after a win, they repeat their move; after a loss or tie, they switch their move. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit their tendency to switch moves after a loss or tie and repeat moves after a win. This strategy should help me maximize my rewards in future rounds.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing with rock against my paper in the last round, they are likely to switch their move. Given their tendency to play scissors after I play paper, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {125: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.1456940714259064, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 144: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.05700000000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {125: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **After a Win:**
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move. For instance, in round 97, they played scissors and lost to my rock. In round 98, they switched to rock and lost to my paper. This pattern suggests they might repeat their move after a win, but the data is not entirely consistent.

2. **After a Loss:**
   - The opponent appears to switch their move. For example, in round 99, they played paper and won against my rock. In round 100, they switched to paper and lost to my scissors. This indicates a tendency to switch after a loss.

3. **After a Tie:**
   - The opponent seems to switch their move. For example, in round 121, both played paper, resulting in a tie. In round 122, they switched to rock, resulting in another tie. This suggests they switch after a tie.

Overall, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as:
- After a win, they tend to repeat their move.
- After a loss, they switch their move.
- After a tie, they switch their move.

This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior. Given this hypothesis, I should play the counter to their predicted move based on their last outcome.

Regarding my rewards:
- I have been getting positive rewards when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock, indicating that the opponent's strategy can be exploited by predicting their next move based on the above pattern.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to use this hypothesis to inform my strategy in future rounds.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they switch their move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to switch from rock to paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.30023041808930395, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 145: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.30023041808930395, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 145: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To understand the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - **Hypothesis 1 (Round 34)**: The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation.
   - **Hypothesis 2 (Round 145)**: After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a tie (e.g., rounds 121-122, 123-124, 126-127, 128-129, 131-132, 133-134, 136-137).
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move (e.g., rounds 98-99, 103-104, 108-109, 114-115).
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move (e.g., rounds 99-100, 104-105, 109-110, 119-120).

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern where they repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie.
   - There is a noticeable tendency for the opponent to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.

4. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - The previous hypotheses align well with the observed data. The opponent's strategy seems to be consistent with repeating after a win and switching after a loss or tie.
   - The tendency to play scissors after I play paper is a pattern that can be exploited by playing rock.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy is to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit the opponent's tendency to play scissors by playing rock, especially after I play paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to switch from scissors. Given their tendency to play scissors after I play paper, they might switch to rock to counter my potential paper play.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely switch to rock, my best play would be paper, as it beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.

                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Rounds 99-105**: The opponent plays a sequence of paper, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper. This sequence doesn't show a clear pattern, but they seem to be cycling through the moves.

2. **Rounds 106-112**: The opponent plays scissors, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors. Again, this sequence doesn't show a clear pattern, but it seems like they might be cycling through moves.

3. **Rounds 113-118**: The opponent plays scissors, rock, paper, paper, paper, rock. This sequence suggests a possible cycle of rock, paper, scissors.

4. **Rounds 119-124**: The opponent plays paper, paper, paper, rock, rock, rock. This sequence suggests a cycle of paper, rock, scissors.

5. **Rounds 125-130**: The opponent plays paper, paper, rock, rock, rock, paper. This sequence suggests a cycle of paper, rock, scissors.

6. **Rounds 131-136**: The opponent plays scissors, scissors, paper, paper, rock, rock. This sequence suggests a cycle of rock, paper, scissors.

7. **Rounds 137-142**: The opponent plays rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, scissors. This sequence suggests a cycle of rock, paper, scissors.

8. **Rounds 143-148**: The opponent plays scissors, rock, paper, paper, rock, scissors. This sequence suggests a cycle of rock, paper, scissors.

From the analysis, it appears that the opponent is following a cyclic pattern of rock, paper, scissors. This pattern is not strictly adhered to, but it seems to be the underlying strategy. 

Given this hypothesis, I can exploit this by playing the move that beats the next expected move in the cycle. For example, if the opponent is expected to play rock next, I should play paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent appears to be following a cyclic pattern of rock, paper, scissors. This pattern is not strictly adhered to, but it seems to be the underlying strategy.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's cyclic pattern of rock, paper, scissors, and considering their last play was scissors, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to play scissors after I play paper. They repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. This pattern can be exploited by playing rock, especially after I play paper.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent tends to play scissors after I play paper, which suggests a tendency to counter paper with scissors.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move.
   - After a loss or tie, the opponent tends to switch their move.

2. **Recent Plays**:
   - In round 148, I played paper and the opponent played scissors, resulting in a loss for me.
   - In round 149, I again played paper and the opponent played scissors, resulting in another loss.

3. **Hypotheses Evaluation**:
   - The previous hypotheses consistently predict that the opponent will play scissors, especially after I play paper.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie.

4. **Static Strategy Consideration**:
   - The opponent's frequent use of scissors after I play paper suggests a static tendency that can be exploited by playing rock.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have received positive rewards when playing rock against scissors, indicating that the opponent's strategy can be countered effectively by playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to play scissors after I play paper. They repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. This pattern can be exploited by playing rock, especially after I play paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to play scissors after I play paper. Since I played paper in the last round and lost, it is likely that the opponent will continue with scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter-move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.4659790334046312, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 145: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.3711104751, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to play scissors frequently, especially after I play paper.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - The opponent's plays seem to be predictable, with a tendency to play scissors, which has been exploited by playing rock.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - There is a noticeable tendency for the opponent to play scissors, particularly after I play paper.
   - The hypotheses have consistently predicted the opponent's next move as scissors, suggesting a strong pattern.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - The pattern of the opponent playing scissors frequently aligns with the positive outcomes when I play rock.

4. **Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a mix of repeating moves after a win and switching after a loss or tie, with a strong inclination towards playing scissors.
   - This pattern is not perfectly consistent but provides a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Based on the analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and has a strong tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper. This pattern can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. In the last round, they played scissors and lost to my rock. Therefore, they are likely to switch from scissors. Given their tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, and considering they lost with scissors, they might switch to rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to play "rock" after I play "paper," which has been exploited successfully multiple times.
   - The opponent often plays "scissors" after I play "paper," leading to losses when I repeat "paper."
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - There is a tendency for the opponent to play "scissors" after I play "paper."
   - The opponent's strategy can be exploited by playing "rock" after I play "paper."

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be a mix of repeating moves after a win and switching after a loss or tie.
   - The opponent has a tendency to play "scissors" after I play "paper," which can be countered by playing "rock."

4. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy is not perfectly consistent but follows a recognizable pattern.
   - The best counter-strategy is to play "rock" after I play "paper," as the opponent often plays "scissors" in response.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing "rock" after the opponent plays "scissors."
   - Negative rewards occur when repeating "paper" against the opponent's "scissors."

Based on this analysis, the opponent's likely policy is to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie, with a tendency to play "scissors" after I play "paper." This pattern can be exploited by playing "rock" after I play "paper."

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They have a tendency to play scissors after I play paper, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. In the last round, they played rock and lost to my paper. Therefore, they are likely to switch their move. Given their tendency to play scissors after I play paper, I predict they will play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {151: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and has a strong tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a tie. For example, after ties in rounds 121, 122, 123, 124, 126, 127, 128, 129, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 146, 147, and 152, they switched their move in the subsequent round.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move. For instance, after winning in rounds 104, 106, 109, 111, 112, 116, 119, 143, 148, and 149, they repeated their move in the next round.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move. This is evident from rounds 103, 105, 107, 108, 110, 113, 114, 115, 117, 118, 120, 125, 130, 139, 140, 141, 142, 144, 145, 150, and 151.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent has a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper. This is consistent with the observed pattern where they often play scissors after I play paper.
   - The opponent's strategy involves repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have been getting positive rewards when playing rock, especially when predicting the opponent's tendency to play scissors after I play paper.

Based on the above analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:
- After a win, the opponent repeats their move.
- After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.
- The opponent has a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper.

This strategy aligns well with the observed data and previous hypotheses. Therefore, I should continue to exploit this pattern by playing rock, especially after I play paper, to counter their tendency to play scissors.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to switch their move. Since the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to switch from rock. Given their tendency to play scissors after I play paper, and considering I played rock last, they might switch to paper to counter my rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my best move would be scissors.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: 
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper. This is evident from the frequent ties when both play scissors and the losses when I play paper.
   - The opponent often repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This pattern is consistent with the previous hypotheses.

2. **Consistency Check**:
   - The hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie aligns with the data. For instance, after a win (round 105, 107, 108), the opponent repeated their move, and after a tie or loss (round 106, 109), they switched.

3. **Exploitation Strategy**:
   - Given the opponent's tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, playing rock seems to be a beneficial strategy. This is supported by the positive rewards received when playing rock against scissors.

4. **Static Strategy Consideration**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a mix of repeating moves after a win and switching after a loss or tie, with a strong inclination towards playing scissors. This suggests a somewhat static strategy that can be exploited by consistently playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations and can be used to inform future plays.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and has a strong tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper. This pattern can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching after a tie and their tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, I predict that their next play will be rock, as we both played scissors in the last round, resulting in a tie.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.

                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {151: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and has a strong tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper. This pattern can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.05700000000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Observation of Patterns:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to repeat moves after a tie, as seen in rounds 121-122, 123-124, 126-127, 128-129, 131-132, 133-134, 135-136, 137-138, 146-147, 152-153, and 153-154.
   - The opponent switches moves after a loss, as seen in rounds 106-107, 111-112, 139-140, and 148-149.
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their winning move, as seen in rounds 105-106, 110-111, 115-116, 120-121, 125-126, 130-131, 141-142, 142-143, 144-145, and 150-151.

2. **Tendency to Play Scissors:**
   - The opponent has a noticeable tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper. This is evident in rounds 106, 111, 116, 131, 137, 143, 148, and 149.

3. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern where they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and repeat after a tie. They have a strong inclination to play scissors, particularly after I play paper.

4. **Exploitation Strategy:**
   - Given the opponent's tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper, I can exploit this by playing rock more frequently.
   - Additionally, since the opponent repeats moves after a tie, I can predict their next move and counter it accordingly.

5. **Reward Analysis:**
   - I have received positive rewards when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock. This suggests that the opponent's strategy can be countered effectively by anticipating their next move based on the observed patterns.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win or tie, switches after a loss, and has a strong tendency to play scissors, especially after I play paper. This pattern can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a tie, and the last round resulted in a tie with both playing paper, I predict that the opponent will play paper again in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.28444709614431635, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and the previous hypothesis:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern was not perfectly consistent but was a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - **Round 155**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock', I lost (-1).
   - **Round 154**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper', it was a tie (0).
   - **Round 153**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors', it was a tie (0).
   - **Round 152**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock', it was a tie (0).
   - **Round 151**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock', I won (3).
   - **Round 150**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors', I won (3).

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - After a tie in round 152, the opponent played the same move in round 153.
   - After a tie in round 153, the opponent played the same move in round 154.
   - After a tie in round 154, the opponent switched from 'paper' to 'rock' in round 155.
   - After a loss in round 151, the opponent switched from 'rock' to 'rock' in round 152 (no switch).
   - After a loss in round 150, the opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'rock' in round 151.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a tie sometimes, but not consistently.
   - The opponent switches their move after a loss, but not always to the same move.
   - The opponent's behavior is not perfectly predictable, but there is a tendency to switch after a loss and sometimes repeat after a tie.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy is not entirely consistent, but there is a tendency to switch moves after a loss and sometimes repeat after a tie.
   - This suggests a semi-random strategy with some patterns.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to switch moves after a loss and sometimes repeats after a tie. Their behavior is not perfectly consistent, indicating a semi-random strategy with some patterns.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of switching moves after a loss, and considering they won the last round with rock against my scissors, they might switch to a different move. Given their semi-random strategy, they might choose paper to counter my potential rock play.

2. 'my_next_play': If the opponent is likely to play paper, I should play scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.4991129673010214, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 82: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.13500362507150998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 117: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.09745602780303986, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 53: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: The previous hypotheses suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their move. For example, in round 139, the opponent played 'rock' and won, and in round 140, they played 'rock' again.
   - **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they tend to switch their move. For instance, in round 141, the opponent played 'rock' and lost, and in round 142, they switched to 'paper'.
   - **Ties**: When there is a tie, the opponent tends to switch their move. For example, in round 121, both played 'paper', and in round 122, the opponent switched to 'rock'.

3. **Consistent Pattern**: The opponent's strategy seems to be consistent with the hypothesis that they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie.

4. **Static Strategy**: There is no indication that the opponent is adapting to my strategy. They seem to follow a static pattern based on the outcome of the previous round.

5. **Reward Analysis**: I have been getting positive rewards when playing 'rock' against 'scissors' and 'paper' against 'rock', which aligns with the hypothesis.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie, and they won the last round with 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'rock' again.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.04937907711071504, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.04937907711071504, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins and Losses:**
   - When the opponent wins (e.g., when they play scissors against my paper), they tend to repeat the winning move. This is evident in rounds 111, 112, 116, 143, 148, 149, 155, 156, and 157 where they played scissors after winning with it.
   - When the opponent loses (e.g., when they play rock against my paper), they tend to switch their move. For instance, in rounds 108, 114, 118, 125, 130, 141, and 145, they switched from rock to another move after losing.

2. **Ties:**
   - In cases of ties, the opponent seems to switch their move. For example, in rounds 121, 122, 123, 124, 126, 127, 128, 129, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, and 138, they switched their move after a tie.

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a mix of repeating a winning move and switching after a loss or tie. This is consistent with the previous hypothesis that they repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie.

4. **Static Strategy:**
   - There is no indication of a static strategy where the opponent plays the same move repeatedly without regard to the outcome. Instead, their behavior is more dynamic, responding to the results of the previous round.

5. **Exploitation Strategy:**
   - Given the opponent's tendency to repeat a winning move, I can exploit this by predicting their next move after a win and countering it. Similarly, after a loss or tie, I can anticipate a switch and adjust my play accordingly.

In summary, the opponent's strategy involves repeating a winning move and switching after a loss or tie. This pattern allows me to predict their next move and choose the optimal counter-strategy.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played scissors and won. According to the guessed strategy, the opponent is likely to repeat their move after a win. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to switch moves after a loss and a tie. For example, after losing with scissors against rock, they switched to paper.
   - After winning, they tend to repeat the same move. For instance, after winning with rock against scissors, they played rock again.
   - There are instances where the opponent played scissors frequently, which suggests a possible preference for this move.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The consistent hypothesis across multiple rounds is that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.
   - The opponent's frequent use of scissors has been noted, suggesting a potential bias towards this move.

3. **Current Strategy Effectiveness:**
   - Playing rock has generally yielded positive rewards, especially when predicting the opponent's frequent use of scissors.
   - The strategy of predicting scissors and countering with rock has been effective, as seen in recent rounds.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating moves after a win and switching moves after a loss or tie, with a notable preference for scissors.
   - This pattern is not perfectly consistent but provides a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a preference for playing scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they lost the last round where they played scissors, it is likely they will switch to a different move. Given their preference for playing scissors frequently, they might switch to rock, which is a common strategy to counter scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to frequently play "rock" after losing or tying, as seen in rounds 114, 118, 130, 145, 151, and 159 where they played "rock" and lost to my "paper".
   - When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their move, as observed in rounds 111, 112, 116, 139, 140, 143, 148, 149, 155, and 156 where they played "scissors" after winning with it.
   - After ties, the opponent switches their move, as seen in rounds 121, 122, 123, 124, 126, 127, 128, 129, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, and 138.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.
   - The opponent shows a preference for playing "scissors" frequently, which can be exploited by playing "rock".

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing "paper" has yielded positive rewards when the opponent plays "rock", which they do often after losing or tying.
   - Playing "rock" has been effective against the opponent's frequent "scissors" plays.

**Conclusion**:
The opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows: They tend to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. They have a preference for playing "scissors" frequently, which can be exploited by playing "rock". This strategy is not perfectly consistent but provides a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a preference for playing scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and given that they lost the last round (they played rock and I played paper), they are likely to switch from rock. Since they show a preference for playing scissors frequently, it is likely they will switch to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and the hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie.
   - This pattern is not perfectly consistent but appears frequently enough to be a reasonable approximation of their behavior.
   - For example, in round 159, the opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper', then switched to 'paper' in round 160.

2. **Hypotheses Evaluation**:
   - Hypotheses 82, 53, and 34 suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.
   - The predicted next plays from these hypotheses have been consistent with the opponent's behavior in recent rounds.

3. **Static Strategy Consideration**:
   - There is no clear evidence that the opponent is playing a static strategy, as their moves change based on the outcome of the previous round.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be reactive rather than static.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards have been obtained when playing 'rock' against 'scissors' and 'paper' against 'rock'.
   - Negative rewards occur when the opponent successfully counters my move, indicating their adaptive strategy.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent likely follows a strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie.
   - This strategy is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to use the hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie to inform my strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they won the last round with 'paper', it is likely that they will repeat their move and play 'paper' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch from 'paper' to 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock' in the next round, my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {82: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.

                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {82: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.19739204148603806, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 53: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.19209741000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - **Hypothesis 1:** After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.
   - **Hypothesis 2:** The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

2. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - **Wins:** When the opponent wins (e.g., rounds 116, 139, 140, 143, 148, 149, 155, 156, 157, 160, 162), they tend to repeat their move in the next round.
   - **Losses:** When the opponent loses (e.g., rounds 113, 114, 115, 117, 118, 120, 125, 130, 141, 142, 144, 145, 150, 151, 158, 159, 161), they tend to switch their move in the next round.
   - **Ties:** When the opponent ties (e.g., rounds 121, 122, 123, 124, 126, 127, 128, 129, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 146, 147, 152, 153, 154), they tend to switch their move in the next round.

3. **Pattern Consistency:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the previous hypotheses. They repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. This pattern is consistent with both hypotheses.

4. **Static Strategy Check:**
   - There is no indication that the opponent is playing a static strategy, as their moves change based on the outcome of the previous round.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy is likely to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. This aligns well with the previous hypotheses and the observed interaction history.

Based on this analysis, the previous hypotheses are still valid and explain the opponent's behavior well. Therefore, I will use this understanding to inform my strategy in future rounds.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {82: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the previous hypotheses.

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. For example, in round 116, they played scissors after losing with rock in round 115.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. For instance, after winning with rock in round 119, they played rock again in round 120.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For example, after tying with paper in round 121, they switched to rock in round 122.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern has been observed multiple times and seems to be a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

3. **Static Strategy Consideration:**
   - When I play rock, I often receive a positive reward, suggesting that the opponent might be playing a strategy that is vulnerable to rock. This aligns with the hypothesis that they switch moves after a loss and repeat after a win, as it allows me to exploit their pattern by playing rock.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: After a win, they repeat their move. After a loss, they switch their move. After a tie, they switch their move. This strategy is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Given this analysis, I will continue to exploit their pattern by playing rock, as it has yielded positive rewards in the past.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch to rock in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {82: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python

                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win. For instance, in round 116, they played scissors after winning with scissors in round 115.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move. For example, in round 117, they switched from scissors to rock after losing in round 116.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For instance, in round 122, they switched from rock to scissors after a tie in round 121.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern has been observed multiple times and aligns well with the interaction history.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play paper, I often receive positive rewards, especially when predicting the opponent will play rock. This suggests that the opponent frequently plays rock, possibly due to the strategy of repeating moves after a win or switching to rock after a loss or tie.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be: repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This strategy is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Given this analysis, I will continue to exploit this pattern by playing paper, as it counters the predicted rock play by the opponent.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and won against the opponent's rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will switch from rock to paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play paper, my best counter-move is scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch from 'paper' to 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to repeat moves after a win and switch moves after a loss or tie. This is evident from the rounds where they won and repeated their move, and where they lost or tied and switched their move.
   - For instance, in round 119, the opponent played paper and won, then repeated paper in round 120. Similarly, in round 139, they played rock and won, then repeated rock in round 140.
   - When they lost, such as in round 118 (opponent played rock and lost), they switched to paper in round 119.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

3. **Current Round Analysis**:
   - In round 166, the opponent played scissors and won. Based on the hypothesis, they are likely to repeat scissors in the next round.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play rock, I tend to get positive rewards against their scissors. This suggests that playing rock could be a good counter-strategy if they repeat scissors.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

This hypothesis will guide my strategy in the upcoming rounds, where I will anticipate their move based on their previous outcome and choose the counter move accordingly.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. Since they won the last round with scissors, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted scissors play, my next move should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.1469896168717485, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 158: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.14499699300000007, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

Top hypotheses: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and see if it aligns with any consistent patterns:

1. **Wins and Losses:**
   - When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their winning move. For example, in round 119, they won with paper and played paper again in round 120.
   - When the opponent loses, they tend to switch their move. For instance, in round 120, they lost with paper and switched to paper again in round 121, which is a tie, and then switched to rock in round 122.

2. **Ties:**
   - When the opponent ties, they tend to switch their move. For example, in round 121, they tied with paper and switched to rock in round 122.

3. **Recent Patterns:**
   - In recent rounds, the opponent has shown a tendency to play paper after winning with it, as seen in rounds 166 and 167.

4. **Static Strategy Analysis:**
   - There is no clear evidence of a static strategy where the opponent plays the same move repeatedly without regard to the outcome. The opponent seems to adjust their move based on the previous round's result.

5. **Hypothesis Consistency:**
   - The previous hypotheses about the opponent repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie seem to hold true for the most part. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Given this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they won the last round with paper, it is likely that they will repeat their move and play paper again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {34: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 139: Opponent wins with rock against my scissors, then switches to rock again in round 140.
   - Round 143: Opponent wins with scissors against my paper, then switches to rock in round 144.

2. **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they tend to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 140: Opponent loses with rock against my scissors, then switches to paper in round 141.
   - Round 144: Opponent loses with scissors against my rock, then switches to rock in round 145.

3. **Ties**: When the opponent ties, they tend to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 122: Both play rock, then opponent switches to scissors in round 123.
   - Round 127: Both play rock, then opponent switches to scissors in round 128.

From the above observations, the opponent seems to follow a pattern where they switch their move after every outcome, whether it's a win, loss, or tie. This behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that the opponent switches their move after each round.

Given this pattern, I have been able to exploit it by predicting their next move and countering it effectively, as seen in rounds where I received positive rewards by playing the counter to their predicted move.

Therefore, my hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is that they switch their move after every round, regardless of the outcome.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches their move after every round, regardless of whether they win, lose, or tie.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after every round, and considering their last play was 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {158: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.5810485265700001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 159: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a preference for playing scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {158: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.5810485265700001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 159: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. They show a preference for playing scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To understand the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.
   - They show a preference for playing scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - **Round 169**: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost.
   - **Round 168**: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won.
   - **Round 167**: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost.
   - **Round 166**: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost.
   - **Round 165**: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - After winning with scissors in round 168, the opponent switched to scissors in round 169.
   - After losing with paper in round 167, the opponent switched to scissors in round 168.
   - After winning with paper in round 165, the opponent switched to scissors in round 166.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to prefer scissors after a win or a loss, as seen in rounds 166, 168, and 169.
   - The opponent switches their move after a loss or a tie, but often chooses scissors.

5. **Static Strategy Consideration**:
   - The opponent's frequent use of scissors suggests a potential static strategy or a strong preference for scissors.

6. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock against the opponent's frequent scissors has resulted in positive rewards.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a win or a loss. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors. This preference for scissors can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to frequently play scissors, especially after a win or a loss, and considering their last play was scissors which resulted in a win for them, I predict their next play will likely be scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.7067339685990001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they played 'scissors' and lost in the last round, it is likely they will switch their play. The pattern suggests they might switch to 'rock' after losing with 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their move. For example:
   - Round 139: Opponent plays rock and wins, repeats rock in round 140.
   - Round 148: Opponent plays scissors and wins, repeats scissors in round 149.

2. **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they tend to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 141: Opponent plays rock and loses, switches to paper in round 142.
   - Round 158: Opponent plays rock and loses, switches to paper in round 159.

3. **Ties**: When the opponent ties, they tend to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 124: Opponent plays paper and ties, switches to rock in round 125.
   - Round 127: Opponent plays rock and ties, switches to scissors in round 128.

The opponent's strategy seems to be a pattern where they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent, but it is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Given this analysis, my strategy should be to anticipate their next move based on this pattern. If they won the last round, I should play the move that beats their repeated move. If they lost or tied, I should play the move that beats their switched move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they won the last round with scissors, it is likely that they will repeat their move and play scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {170: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a win or a loss. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors. This preference for scissors can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.045899999999999996, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {170: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a win or a loss. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors. This preference for scissors can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.045899999999999996, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and see if there are any patterns:

1. **Frequent Plays**: The opponent has shown a tendency to play scissors, especially after a win or a loss. This is evident from the rounds where they played scissors after losing or tying.

2. **Response to Losses and Ties**: After a loss or a tie, the opponent often switches moves but frequently chooses scissors. This suggests a preference for scissors in uncertain situations.

3. **Static Strategy or Pattern**: The opponent might be following a pattern where they favor scissors, but they do switch moves occasionally. This could indicate a semi-static strategy with a bias towards scissors.

4. **Exploiting the Pattern**: Given the frequent occurrence of scissors, playing rock more often could be beneficial. This has been successful in previous rounds where rock was played against scissors.

5. **Reward Analysis**: When playing rock, especially after predicting scissors, the rewards have been positive. This supports the hypothesis that the opponent favors scissors.

In summary, the opponent seems to have a bias towards playing scissors, especially after a loss or a tie. This can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a win or a loss. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors. This preference for scissors can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to play scissors frequently, especially after a win or a loss, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing rock, it is likely that the opponent will switch to scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {170: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a win or a loss. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors. This preference for scissors can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.33213, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 175: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a win or a loss.

This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.2367107781024339, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 168: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and the hypotheses:

1. **Observation of Opponent's Plays:**
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a win or a loss.
   - They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors.
   - There is a noticeable preference for scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.

2. **Patterns in Opponent's Behavior:**
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their move.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move.
   - These patterns are not perfectly consistent but are a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

3. **Analysis of Rewards:**
   - Playing rock has consistently yielded positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - The strategy of playing rock more frequently has been effective, given the opponent's tendency to choose scissors.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating moves after a win and switching moves after a loss or tie, with a strong inclination towards playing scissors.
   - This strategy can be effectively countered by playing rock more often, as it exploits the opponent's frequent choice of scissors.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations. The opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a win or a loss. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors. This preference for scissors can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to frequently play scissors, especially after a win or a loss, and considering that they just lost the last round where they played scissors, it is likely they might switch their play. However, given their preference for scissors, they might still play scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock again, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {158: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.4656975446717037, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 168: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.
   - In the recent rounds, the opponent played 'rock' in rounds 174 and 176, both resulting in ties. According to the hypothesis, they should switch after a tie.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The previous hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.
   - The predicted opponent's next play was 'rock' in the last hypothesis, and the recommended play for me was 'paper'.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When playing 'rock', the rewards have been mixed, with ties and some wins.
   - Playing 'paper' has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays 'rock'.

4. **Current Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent is likely following a strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the previous observations. The opponent is likely to switch their move after a tie, which suggests they might play 'paper' next.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to switch from rock. The most common switch from rock in the opponent's pattern has been to scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {158: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 170: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a win or a loss.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a loss or a tie.
   - The opponent tends to switch moves after a loss or a tie but often chooses scissors.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a win or a loss. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - In recent rounds, playing rock has consistently yielded positive rewards, indicating that the opponent often plays scissors.
   - The opponent's behavior suggests a preference for scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve a preference for scissors, especially after a loss or a tie. They may switch moves but often revert to scissors.
   - This preference for scissors can be exploited by consistently playing rock, which has been yielding positive rewards.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy is likely a static or semi-static preference for scissors, with occasional switches after losses or ties. This can be countered by playing rock more frequently.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations and suggests a strategy to exploit the opponent's preference for scissors.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a loss or a tie. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors. This preference for scissors can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to play scissors frequently, especially after a loss or a tie, and considering they lost the last round with scissors against my rock, it is likely they will switch their move. However, since they often choose scissors, they might still play scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the likelihood that the opponent might play scissors again, my best counter would be to continue playing rock to exploit their preference for scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.7381917968891348, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to switch from rock. The most common switch from rock in their pattern has been to paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to play scissors frequently, especially after ties and losses.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.
   - The opponent's behavior is not perfectly consistent, but there is a noticeable preference for scissors.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - Hypotheses suggest that the opponent often plays scissors, especially after a loss or a tie.
   - The opponent tends to switch moves after a loss or a tie but often chooses scissors.
   - There is a pattern where the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing rock, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing paper against scissors or rock against paper.

4. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - Given the frequent occurrence of scissors by the opponent, playing rock more frequently can be beneficial.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve a preference for scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy involves a frequent choice of scissors, especially after ties and losses.
   - Playing rock more often can counter this tendency and maximize rewards.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's likely strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a loss or a tie. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors. This preference for scissors can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of frequently playing scissors, especially after a tie, and given that the last round ended in a tie with both playing scissors, it is likely that the opponent will play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Repeated Patterns**: The opponent has shown a tendency to play the same move consecutively, especially when it results in a tie. For example, they played 'scissors' multiple times in a row (rounds 131, 134, 137, 153, 179) and 'rock' (rounds 133, 136, 146, 152, 174, 176, 178).

2. **Response to Losses**: When the opponent loses, they tend to switch to a move that beats the move they lost to. For instance:
   - After losing with 'scissors' to 'rock' (round 139), they switched to 'rock' in round 140.
   - After losing with 'rock' to 'paper' (round 160), they switched to 'scissors' in round 161.

3. **Response to Wins**: When the opponent wins, they often repeat the winning move. For example:
   - After winning with 'rock' against 'scissors' (round 140), they played 'rock' again in round 141.
   - After winning with 'scissors' against 'paper' (round 162), they played 'scissors' again in round 163.

4. **Response to Ties**: The opponent tends to repeat the move that resulted in a tie. For example:
   - After tying with 'scissors' (round 131), they played 'scissors' again in round 134.
   - After tying with 'rock' (round 133), they played 'rock' again in round 136.

**Hypothesis**: The opponent seems to follow a strategy where:
- After a win, they repeat the winning move.
- After a loss, they switch to the move that beats the move they lost to.
- After a tie, they repeat the move that resulted in a tie.

Given this hypothesis, I can exploit their strategy by anticipating their next move based on the outcome of the previous round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats the winning move. After a loss, the opponent switches to the move that beats the move they lost to. After a tie, the opponent repeats the move that resulted in a tie.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after winning the last round with paper against my rock, they are likely to repeat their winning move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted play of paper, my best move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.1800969117069387, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: 
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win.
   - After a loss, they switch to the move that beats the move they lost to.
   - After a tie, they often switch their move, though sometimes they repeat it.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they often repeat their winning move. For example, in round 139, they played rock after winning with rock in round 138.
   - **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they tend to switch to the move that beats the move they lost to. For instance, in round 140, after losing with rock to scissors, they switched to paper in round 141.
   - **Ties**: After ties, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, but they also switch occasionally. This inconsistency makes it challenging to predict their exact behavior after a tie.

3. **Pattern Consistency**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating moves after wins and switching moves after losses. The behavior after ties is less consistent but leans towards switching.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing scissors has often resulted in positive rewards, especially when predicting the opponent's next move as paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their winning move. After a loss, they switch to the move that beats the move they lost to. After a tie, they tend to switch their move, but this is less consistent.'
}
```

This hypothesis suggests that the opponent is not playing a static strategy but rather a reactive one based on the outcome of the previous round. The strategy involves exploiting their tendency to repeat moves after wins and switch moves after losses.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played scissors and won against their paper. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch to the move that beats the move they lost to. Since they lost to scissors, they are likely to play rock next to beat my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Ties**: There are several instances where both players played the same move, resulting in a tie. This suggests that the opponent might be playing a predictable pattern or repeating moves.

2. **Losses**: When I played scissors, the opponent often played rock, resulting in a loss for me. Similarly, when I played paper, the opponent often played scissors, leading to a loss.

3. **Wins**: When I played rock, I frequently won against scissors, and when I played paper, I often won against rock.

4. **Pattern Recognition**: The opponent seems to have a tendency to play rock after I play scissors and scissors after I play paper. This pattern suggests that the opponent might be using a strategy that counters my previous move.

5. **Static Strategy**: The opponent might be using a static strategy where they play a move that beats my previous move. This is evident from the consistent losses when I play paper and scissors.

6. **Exploiting the Strategy**: If the opponent is indeed playing a move that beats my previous move, I can exploit this by playing the move that beats their expected counter. For example, if I play rock, they might play paper next, so I should play scissors.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is that the opponent is using a strategy that counters my previous move. Therefore, I should play the move that beats their expected counter.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that beats my previous move. 
                      If I play rock, they play paper. 
                      If I play paper, they play scissors. 
                      If I play scissors, they play rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent plays the move that beats my previous move, and my last play was paper, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Patterns of Wins and Losses**: 
     - When I play rock, I often win against scissors (e.g., rounds 144, 150, 158, 163, 170, 175, 177, 183).
     - When I play paper, I win against rock (e.g., rounds 141, 145, 151, 159, 164, 171).
     - When I play scissors, I win against paper (e.g., rounds 142, 161, 165, 168, 172, 181).
   - **Patterns of Losses**:
     - When I play scissors, I lose to rock (e.g., rounds 139, 140, 155, 156).
     - When I play paper, I lose to scissors (e.g., rounds 143, 148, 149, 157, 162, 166, 169, 173, 182).
     - When I play rock, I lose to paper (e.g., rounds 160, 167, 180).

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent often plays the move that beats my previous move.
   - After a win, the opponent repeats the winning move. After a loss, they switch to the move that beats the move they lost to. After a tie, they repeat the move that resulted in a tie.

3. **Current Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent seems to be following a strategy where they often play the move that beats my previous move. This is evident from the consistent wins when I play rock against their scissors and paper against their rock. However, they also switch strategies occasionally, especially after losses or ties.

4. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - Given the pattern, it seems beneficial to continue playing rock, as it has consistently resulted in wins against their scissors. This suggests they might be playing a strategy that often results in them choosing scissors after certain conditions.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of playing the move that beats my previous move and occasionally switching after losses or ties. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent plays the move that beats my previous move. If I play rock, they play paper. If I play paper, they play scissors. If I play scissors, they play rock. They also switch strategies occasionally, especially after losses or ties.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing the move that beats my previous move, and considering that I last played rock, the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round to beat my rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern has been observed in multiple rounds, as noted in previous hypotheses.
   - For example, in round 183, the opponent played scissors and lost, then switched to rock in round 184. This aligns with the hypothesis that they switch after a loss.

2. **Consistency Check**:
   - The hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie has been consistent across several rounds. This is evident from the rounds where the opponent repeated their move after winning (e.g., rounds 175 and 177) and switched after losing (e.g., rounds 180 and 184).

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play rock, I tend to get positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors. This suggests that the opponent might be playing scissors more frequently after certain conditions, such as after a loss or tie.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - Given the observed pattern, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as: "The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie." This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

5. **Strategy Implication**:
   - To counter this strategy, I should anticipate the opponent's next move based on their previous outcome. If they lost the last round, they are likely to switch their move. If they won, they might repeat the same move.

Based on this analysis, here is the refined hypothesis:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and won. According to the guessed strategy, the opponent tends to repeat their move after a win. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: The consistent hypothesis across multiple rounds is that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This hypothesis has been applied in rounds 158, 53, 82, 161, and 185, with varying confidence values.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their move. For example, in round 180, the opponent played paper and won against my rock, and in round 181, they played paper again.
   - **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they switch their move. For instance, in round 184, the opponent played rock and lost to my scissors, and in round 185, they switched to rock.
   - **Ties**: When there's a tie, the opponent switches their move. For example, in round 136, both played rock, resulting in a tie, and in round 137, the opponent switched to scissors.

3. **Pattern Consistency**: The pattern of repeating after a win and switching after a loss or tie is not perfectly consistent but appears to be a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

4. **Reward Analysis**: When I play paper, I often receive a positive reward, especially when the opponent plays rock. This suggests that the opponent frequently plays rock, which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch to rock after a loss or tie.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie remains a valid explanation of their behavior. This pattern allows me to predict their next move and choose a counter strategy accordingly.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper'. According to the guessed strategy, the opponent switches after a loss. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' from the opponent, I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {158: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.2026972215654096, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their move. For example:
   - Round 139: Opponent wins with rock, plays rock again in round 140.
   - Round 143: Opponent wins with scissors, plays scissors again in round 144.

2. **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they tend to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 141: Opponent loses with rock, switches to paper in round 142.
   - Round 145: Opponent loses with rock, switches to scissors in round 146.

3. **Ties**: When the opponent ties, they tend to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 138: Tie with paper, switches to rock in round 139.
   - Round 146: Tie with rock, switches to scissors in round 147.

This pattern aligns with the hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent, but it is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Given this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

This hypothesis will guide my strategy in future rounds by predicting the opponent's next move based on the outcome of the previous round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played scissors and won. According to the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine my opponent's strategy, let's analyze their behavior based on the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Observation of Patterns:**
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss. For example, when they played 'rock' and lost to my 'paper', they switched to 'scissors' in the next round.
   - After a win, the opponent seems to repeat their move. For instance, when they won with 'rock' against my 'scissors', they played 'rock' again in the next round.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. This is seen when both played 'rock', and the opponent switched to 'scissors' in the next round.

2. **Consistency with Hypotheses:**
   - The previous hypotheses suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This pattern aligns with the observed behavior in the interaction history.
   - The hypothesis with the highest value (0.569) suggests this pattern is a reasonable approximation of their behavior, and it has been consistent across multiple rounds.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - I have been getting positive rewards when playing 'rock' against their 'scissors', which they switch to after losing with 'rock' or tying with 'rock'.
   - This indicates that the opponent's strategy is somewhat predictable and can be exploited by playing 'rock' more frequently.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit this pattern by playing 'rock' when I predict they will play 'scissors'.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they lost the last round (they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to switch from scissors to paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round, my best counter move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern is observed consistently but not perfectly.
   - Recent rounds show that when the opponent wins with 'rock', they tend to repeat 'rock' in the next round.
   - When the opponent loses, they switch their move. For example, when they lost with 'scissors', they switched to 'rock' or 'paper' in the next round.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.
   - The predicted opponent's next play has often been 'rock', and the suggested counter is 'paper'.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are frequently obtained when playing 'paper' against the opponent's 'rock'.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing 'scissors' against the opponent's 'rock'.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a pattern where they repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.
   - Given the interaction history and previous hypotheses, the opponent is likely to play 'rock' again if they won the last round with 'rock'.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations. The opponent's strategy is likely to be:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering the last interaction where they won with 'rock', it is likely that they will repeat 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.8522404692498153, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they lost the last round (since I played scissors and they played paper), they are likely to switch their play. Given their pattern, they might switch to rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {185: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.4659, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 158: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.2965683284748708, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 188: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and see if the previous hypothesis holds or needs refinement.

1. **Pattern Recognition**: The previous hypothesis suggests that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. Let's verify this with the recent rounds:

   - **Round 191**: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won. 
     - Next round (192), opponent played scissors. This aligns with the hypothesis as they switched after a loss.
   
   - **Round 190**: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won.
     - Next round (191), opponent played paper. This aligns with the hypothesis as they switched after a loss.
   
   - **Round 189**: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost.
     - Next round (190), opponent played rock. This aligns with the hypothesis as they repeated after a win.
   
   - **Round 188**: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won.
     - Next round (189), opponent played rock. This aligns with the hypothesis as they switched after a loss.

2. **Consistency Check**: The hypothesis seems to hold consistently over the recent rounds. The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie.

3. **Reward Analysis**: When I play rock, I tend to get positive rewards more often, especially when predicting the opponent's switch to scissors or repeat of rock.

Given the above analysis, the previous hypothesis still explains the data well. The opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted scissors play by the opponent, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent seems to switch their move after a loss and a tie, and repeat their move after a win. This is evident from the pattern observed in the interaction history.
   - For example, in round 192, the opponent played scissors after losing with scissors in round 191, indicating a switch. In round 193, they played scissors again after losing with scissors in round 192, indicating a switch after a loss.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The previous hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This pattern has been observed multiple times and seems to be a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - When playing rock, I have received positive rewards frequently, especially against scissors. This suggests that the opponent often plays scissors, which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch to scissors after a loss or tie.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be: repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Given this analysis, I will continue to exploit this pattern by playing rock, as it has yielded positive rewards against the opponent's frequent choice of scissors.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and considering that they lost the last round (they played scissors and I played rock), they are likely to switch their move. Therefore, their next play is likely to be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they seem to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 148: Opponent wins with scissors against my paper, then switches to rock in round 149.
   - Round 160: Opponent wins with paper against my rock, then switches to scissors in round 161.

2. **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they seem to switch their move as well. For example:
   - Round 145: Opponent loses with rock against my paper, then switches to rock again in round 146.
   - Round 150: Opponent loses with scissors against my rock, then switches to rock in round 151.

3. **Ties**: When the opponent ties, they also switch their move. For example:
   - Round 146: Tie with rock, opponent switches to scissors in round 147.
   - Round 154: Tie with paper, opponent switches to scissors in round 155.

From this analysis, it appears that the opponent switches their move after every round, regardless of the outcome. This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that the opponent switches their move after every round, which aligns with the previous hypotheses.

Regarding my rewards:
- I receive positive rewards when I predict the opponent's switch correctly and play the counter move.
- I receive negative rewards when I fail to predict the switch or play the wrong counter move.

Given this pattern, I can exploit the opponent's strategy by anticipating their switch and playing the counter move accordingly.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches their move after every round, regardless of the outcome.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after every round, and the fact that they played 'paper' in the last round, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {53: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.44939607367398005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and observe patterns in their behavior:

1. **Consistent Patterns**: 
   - The opponent seems to favor playing scissors after winning with it. For example, in rounds 148, 149, 157, 162, 166, 169, 173, 182, 187, and 192, they played scissors after winning or drawing with it.
   - After losing with rock, they tend to switch to scissors, as seen in rounds 155, 156, 184, and 189.
   - After losing with paper, they tend to switch to scissors, as seen in rounds 160 and 180.

2. **Switching Behavior**:
   - The opponent often switches to scissors after losing with either rock or paper, indicating a preference for scissors in these situations.

3. **Static Strategy**:
   - The opponent seems to have a bias towards playing scissors, especially after a loss or a tie, which suggests a static strategy that can be exploited.

4. **Exploiting the Strategy**:
   - Given the opponent's tendency to play scissors frequently, especially after a loss or tie, playing rock consistently could yield positive rewards.

5. **Rewards Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors, which aligns with their frequent choice.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and often repeats scissors after winning with it. This suggests a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's tendency to play scissors after losing or tying, and given that they played scissors in the last round and won, it is likely they will continue with scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {53: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after losing or tying.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win.
   - The opponent seems to have a bias towards playing scissors, as observed in multiple rounds.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - Hypotheses suggest that the opponent often plays scissors after losing or tying.
   - The opponent might repeat their move after a win.
   - There is a consistent prediction that the opponent will play scissors, leading to the recommendation of playing rock.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing rock has consistently resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - This suggests that the opponent's strategy might be static or heavily biased towards scissors.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis:**
   - Given the consistent success of playing rock, it seems the opponent has a strong tendency to play scissors.
   - The opponent's strategy might not be adaptive but rather a static preference for scissors.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent likely has a static strategy with a bias towards playing scissors.
   - This can be exploited by consistently playing rock to counter their strategy.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent has a strong bias towards playing scissors, especially after losing or tying. This suggests a static strategy that can be countered by consistently playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strong bias towards playing scissors, especially after losing or tying, and considering they lost the last round when I played rock, I predict their next play will likely be scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter would be to play rock again to maximize my chances of winning.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.7302040761002502, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. In the last round, the result was a tie with both playing rock. According to the strategy, the opponent is likely to switch their move after a tie. Therefore, they might switch to paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper in the next round, my best counter-move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, as observed in many rounds.
   - After losing or tying, the opponent often plays scissors again, suggesting a bias towards this move.
   - The opponent sometimes repeats their move after a win, but this pattern is not perfectly consistent.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - Several hypotheses suggest that the opponent has a strong bias towards playing scissors, especially after losing or tying.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve repeating moves after a win and switching after a loss or tie, but with a noticeable preference for scissors.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has consistently yielded positive rewards, indicating that the opponent's strategy is vulnerable to rock.
   - The opponent's frequent use of scissors can be exploited by consistently playing rock.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent likely has a static strategy with a bias towards scissors, especially after losing or tying. This can be countered effectively by playing rock consistently.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent has a strong bias towards playing scissors, especially after losing or tying. This suggests a static strategy that can be countered by consistently playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strong bias towards playing scissors, especially after losing or tying, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict their next play will likely be scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their strategy effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {161: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.6090965591954776, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 186: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.30770259, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {161: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.6090965591954776, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 186: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.30770259, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: The opponent was hypothesized to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern was not perfectly consistent but was a reasonable approximation.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - **Round 199**: Tie (rock vs. rock) - Opponent played rock.
   - **Round 198**: Tie (scissors vs. scissors) - Opponent played scissors.
   - **Round 197**: Tie (rock vs. rock) - Opponent played rock.
   - **Round 196**: Win for me (rock vs. scissors) - Opponent played scissors.
   - **Round 195**: Loss for me (paper vs. scissors) - Opponent played scissors.
   - **Round 194**: Tie (paper vs. paper) - Opponent played paper.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., rounds 199, 198, 197).
   - After a loss, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., round 195).
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats the same move (e.g., round 196).

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to repeat their move regardless of the outcome, but this is not perfectly consistent. The previous hypothesis that they switch after a loss or tie is not strongly supported by recent data.

5. **Strategy Implication**:
   - Given the tendency to repeat moves, I can exploit this by playing the counter to their last move. If they played rock, I should play paper; if they played paper, I should play scissors; if they played scissors, I should play rock.

Based on this analysis, here's the refined hypothesis:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent tends to repeat their move regardless of the outcome, but this is not perfectly consistent. Exploit by playing the counter to their last move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's tendency to repeat their move regardless of the outcome, and considering that their last play was 'rock', I predict that their next play will likely be 'rock' again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {196: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and often repeats scissors after winning with it. This suggests a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 161: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {196: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and often repeats scissors after winning with it. This suggests a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 161: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.1263675914368343, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - **Hypothesis 196:** The opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and often repeats scissors after winning with it. This suggests a bias towards scissors.
   - **Hypothesis 161:** The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

2. **Recent Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent played scissors in rounds 200, 199, 198, 197, 195, 192, 191, 187, 186, 183, 182, 181, 180, 179, 178, 177, 176, 175, 174, 173, 172, 171, 170, 169, 168, 167, 166, 165, 164, 163, 162, 161, 160, 159, 158, 157, 156, 155, 154, 153, 152, 151.
   - The opponent tends to play scissors frequently, especially after losing or tying, which aligns with Hypothesis 196.
   - The opponent's behavior after a win is less consistent but shows some tendency to repeat the winning move.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing rock has often resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - Playing paper has resulted in negative rewards when the opponent plays scissors.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent seems to have a bias towards playing scissors, especially after losing or tying. This suggests that playing rock consistently could be a beneficial strategy to exploit this bias.

Based on this analysis, I will refine the hypothesis to focus on the opponent's tendency to play scissors frequently, especially after losing or tying.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after losing or tying. This suggests a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to frequently play scissors, especially after losing or tying, and considering that they just won with scissors against my paper, it is likely they will continue with scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after losing or tying. This suggests a bias towards scissors.
   - There are instances where the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. However, this pattern is not perfectly consistent.
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be somewhat predictable, with a tendency to favor scissors.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - Several hypotheses suggest that the opponent frequently plays scissors, particularly after losing or tying. This indicates a potential bias towards scissors.
   - Another hypothesis suggests that the opponent plays the move that beats my previous move, but this is less consistent with the observed data.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has consistently yielded positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - This suggests that the opponent's strategy may be static or biased towards scissors, which can be exploited by consistently playing rock.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be biased towards playing scissors, particularly after losing or tying. This can be effectively countered by playing rock consistently.

Based on this analysis, the most effective strategy is to continue playing rock, as it has consistently resulted in positive rewards against the opponent's likely bias towards scissors.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after losing or tying. This suggests a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to play scissors frequently, especially after losing or tying, and considering that they lost the last round when I played rock, it is likely they will play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best strategy is to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins and Repeats**: The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win. For example, in rounds 155 and 156, they won with rock and repeated rock.

2. **Losses and Switches**: After losing, the opponent often switches their move. For instance, in round 157, they lost with scissors and switched to rock in round 158.

3. **Ties and Switches**: The opponent seems to switch their move after a tie. For example, in round 174, they tied with rock and switched to scissors in round 175.

4. **Bias Towards Scissors**: There is a noticeable bias towards playing scissors, especially after losses or ties. This is evident in rounds 180, 182, and 184 where they played scissors after losing or tying.

5. **Static Strategy**: The opponent does not seem to adapt dynamically to my plays but follows a pattern that can be predicted and exploited.

Given these observations, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

- The opponent repeats their move after a win.
- The opponent switches their move after a loss or a tie.
- There is a bias towards playing scissors, especially after losses or ties.

This pattern is not perfectly consistent but provides a reasonable approximation of their behavior. To exploit this, I should focus on playing rock more frequently, as it counters their bias towards scissors and their tendency to switch to scissors after ties and losses.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or a tie, with a bias towards playing scissors after losses or ties.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie, with a bias towards playing scissors after losses or ties, the opponent played 'rock' in the last round which resulted in a tie. Therefore, it is likely that they will switch their play to 'scissors' in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be to play 'rock' to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after losing or tying. This suggests a bias towards scissors.
   - When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their move.
   - After a loss or a tie, the opponent often switches their move, with a tendency to play scissors.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent has a bias towards playing scissors after losses or ties.
   - They repeat their move after a win.
   - The opponent's strategy is not perfectly consistent but shows a pattern that can be exploited by playing rock consistently.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has consistently yielded positive rewards, especially against scissors, which the opponent frequently plays.
   - This suggests that the opponent's strategy is somewhat static, with a bias towards scissors.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as having a bias towards scissors, especially after losses or ties, and repeating their move after a win.
   - This pattern can be exploited by playing rock consistently, as it counters the opponent's frequent choice of scissors.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be effectively countered by playing rock, as it takes advantage of their bias towards scissors.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and repeats their move after a win. This suggests a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to play scissors after losing or tying, and the fact that they lost the last round, I predict their next play will likely be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted scissors play by the opponent, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {161: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.3702408587039839, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This hypothesis was made at round 161 and predicted the opponent would play 'rock' next, which was correct for round 204.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they tend to repeat their move. For example, in rounds 155 and 156, they played 'rock' after winning with 'rock'.
   - **Losses**: After losing, the opponent switches their move. For instance, in round 158, they lost with 'scissors' and switched to 'rock' in round 159.
   - **Ties**: After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For example, in round 174, they tied with 'rock' and switched to 'scissors' in round 175.

3. **Static Strategy Consideration**: The opponent seems to have a pattern of repeating moves after a win and switching after a loss or tie. This pattern is consistent with the previous hypothesis and is supported by the recent rounds.

4. **Reward Analysis**: When I play 'rock', I have received mixed rewards, indicating that the opponent does not play a static strategy that can be easily exploited by playing 'rock' consistently.

5. **Conclusion**: The opponent's strategy aligns with the hypothesis that they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This strategy is not perfectly consistent but provides a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to use the hypothesis to predict the opponent's next move and choose my counter-strategy accordingly.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to switch after a tie. In the last round, both of us played rock, resulting in a tie. Therefore, it is likely that the opponent will switch from rock to paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, I should play scissors in the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {196: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and often repeats scissors after winning with it. This suggests a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently.', 'value': 0.24077426910000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 203: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or a tie, with a bias towards playing scissors after losses or ties.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 201: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after losing or tying.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to play scissors frequently, especially after ties or losses.
   - There are several instances where the opponent repeated their move after a win, particularly when they played scissors.
   - The opponent often switches their move after a loss or a tie, but the switch seems biased towards scissors.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and often repeats scissors after winning with it.
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or a tie, with a bias towards playing scissors after losses or ties.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - The recent rounds (e.g., 198, 199, 204, 205) show a pattern where the opponent plays scissors after a tie or loss.
   - When the opponent wins with a move, they tend to repeat it, especially if it's scissors.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when predicting the opponent's bias towards scissors.
   - There are instances where playing rock has led to ties, but overall, it has been effective against the opponent's frequent scissors plays.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent seems to have a static strategy with a strong bias towards playing scissors, especially after ties or losses.
   - This strategy can be exploited by consistently playing rock, which has yielded positive rewards in the past.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations: the opponent has a bias towards playing scissors, particularly after ties or losses, and tends to repeat their move after a win.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and often repeats scissors after winning with it. This suggests a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to frequently play scissors after losing or tying, and the fact that the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict that their next play will likely be scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {161: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.27141802076495214, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {161: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.27141802076495214, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Wins and Losses**:
   - When I play **rock** and win, the opponent plays **scissors**. If I lose, the opponent plays **paper**.
   - When I play **paper** and win, the opponent plays **rock**. If I lose, the opponent plays **scissors**.
   - When I play **scissors** and win, the opponent plays **paper**. If I lose, the opponent plays **rock**.

2. **Ties**:
   - When there is a tie, the opponent seems to switch to a move that would beat their last move.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win.
   - The opponent switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.
   - The opponent switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie.

4. **Static Strategy**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating their winning move and switching to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play **rock**, I have a mix of wins and losses, suggesting the opponent sometimes plays **scissors** and sometimes **paper**.
   - When I play **paper**, I have a mix of wins and losses, suggesting the opponent sometimes plays **rock** and sometimes **scissors**.
   - When I play **scissors**, I have a mix of wins and losses, suggesting the opponent sometimes plays **paper** and sometimes **rock**.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be 'paper' again.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {161: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.4899926145354665, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 207: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win.
   - After a loss or a tie, they switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - There is a bias towards playing scissors after losses or ties.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - When the opponent loses, they often switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - When the opponent ties, they also tend to switch to a move that would beat their last move.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays scissors frequently, especially after losses or ties.

3. **Recent Rounds**:
   - In round 206, the opponent played paper after losing with scissors in round 205, which aligns with the hypothesis of switching to a move that would beat their last move.
   - In round 207, the opponent played paper again after losing with paper in round 206, which suggests they might not always switch after a loss but could repeat the move occasionally.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing scissors has been effective against the opponent's frequent paper plays, resulting in positive rewards.
   - Playing rock has also been effective against their frequent scissors plays.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent seems to have a strategy where they repeat their move after a win and switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie. However, there is a tendency to play scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie, with a tendency to play scissors frequently. This can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win and switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie. In the last round, the opponent played paper and lost. According to their strategy, they are likely to switch to scissors, which beats paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to play scissors frequently, especially after losses or ties.
   - After a win, the opponent often repeats their move.
   - After a loss or tie, the opponent switches moves, often choosing scissors.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent has a tendency to play scissors frequently, especially after losses or ties.
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win.
   - The opponent switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie.

3. **Current Observations**:
   - In the recent rounds, playing rock has consistently resulted in positive rewards, particularly when the opponent plays scissors.
   - The opponent's frequent choice of scissors can be exploited by playing rock more often.

4. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating moves after wins and switching to scissors after losses or ties.
   - This pattern is not perfectly consistent but shows a strong bias towards scissors.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as having a preference for scissors, especially after losses or ties, and repeating moves after wins. This can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie, with a tendency to play scissors frequently. This can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie, and considering their tendency to play scissors frequently, the opponent played scissors in the last round and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch to rock in the next round to beat scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round, my best move to counter this would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Observation of Patterns:**
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win.
   - After a loss or tie, the opponent switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - There is a noted tendency for the opponent to play scissors frequently.

2. **Consistency with Hypotheses:**
   - The previous hypotheses suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie.
   - The opponent's frequent play of scissors is also noted, which can be exploited by playing rock.

3. **Recent Rounds Analysis:**
   - In round 209, the opponent played rock after losing with scissors in round 208, which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss.
   - The opponent's behavior seems to fit the pattern described in the hypotheses, with a tendency to play scissors frequently.

4. **Exploitation Strategy:**
   - Given the opponent's tendency to play scissors frequently and switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie, playing rock can be a beneficial strategy.
   - The opponent's strategy is not perfectly consistent, but the pattern is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy involves repeating their move after a win, switching to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie, and a frequent tendency to play scissors. This can be exploited by playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie, with a tendency to play scissors frequently. This can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie, and considering their tendency to play scissors frequently, I believe their next play will be scissors. This is because they lost the last round when they played rock, so they are likely to switch to scissors, which beats paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.7599, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switch to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and won. According to their strategy, they are likely to repeat their winning move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.8319300000000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. According to their pattern, after a loss, they switch to a move that would beat their last move, which was 'paper'. Therefore, their likely next play is 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.94235199, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost to my 'scissors'. According to their strategy, after a loss, they switch to a move that would beat their last move. Therefore, their likely play in the next round is 'rock' to beat 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.9802267325699999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switch to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. In the last round, the opponent played scissors and lost. According to their strategy, they should switch to a move that would beat scissors, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock in the next round, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. According to their pattern, after a loss, they switch to a move that would beat their last move. Therefore, it is likely that they will play 'paper' next to beat 'rock'.

                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

Top hypotheses: {207: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.39321776927151, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 65: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and frequently plays scissors.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the recent interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Recent Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent seems to switch their move after a loss or tie. For example, after losing with rock against paper, they switched to scissors.
   - After winning with scissors against paper, they repeated scissors.
   - This pattern suggests a tendency to repeat a winning move and switch after a loss or tie.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - Hypothesis 207 suggests the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie.
   - Hypotheses 65 and 70 suggest the opponent frequently plays scissors and switches after a loss or tie, with a preference for rock after losing to paper.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - The opponent's recent plays align with the hypothesis that they repeat a winning move and switch after a loss or tie.
   - They have shown a preference for playing scissors after a win and switching to rock after losing to paper.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve repeating a winning move and switching to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie.
   - They show a preference for scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock more often.

Based on this analysis, the previous hypothesis 207 seems to be a good fit for explaining the opponent's strategy. Therefore, I will continue to use this hypothesis to inform my strategy.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played 'scissors' and won. Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent often plays scissors, which has been exploited by playing rock.
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their move.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - The opponent's behavior is not perfectly consistent but shows a tendency to play scissors frequently.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie.
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.
   - The opponent's strategy is not perfectly consistent but follows a pattern that can be approximated.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has consistently yielded positive rewards, especially against scissors.
   - The opponent's frequent use of scissors suggests a static strategy that can be countered by playing rock more often.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy involves repeating their move after a win and switching to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie.
   - They have a tendency to play scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie, and frequently plays scissors. This can be exploited by playing rock more often.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win and switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch to rock, which would beat their last move, scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.7918736948601279, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. In the last round, they played paper and lost to my scissors. According to their strategy, after a loss, they switch to a move that would beat their last move, which was paper. Therefore, their likely next play is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {207: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.2543115864020896, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 210: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie, with a tendency to play scissors frequently. This can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.18903559118649, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {207: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.2543115864020896, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 210: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie, with a tendency to play scissors frequently. This can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.18903559118649, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - **Hypothesis 207**: The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.
   - **Hypothesis 210**: The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie, with a tendency to play scissors frequently. This can be exploited by playing rock.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to play scissors frequently, as seen in rounds 182, 187, 192, 195, 200, 220, and 224.
   - After a loss, the opponent often switches to a move that would beat their last move. For example, after losing with rock in round 210, they switched to paper in round 211.
   - After a tie, the opponent also tends to switch to a move that would beat their last move, as seen in rounds 179 and 198.
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win, as seen in rounds 176, 178, 197, and 199.

3. **Current Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches to a move that would beat their last move.
   - The opponent has a tendency to play scissors frequently.

Given this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating moves after a win and switching to a counter-move after a loss or tie, with a frequent inclination towards playing scissors. This strategy can be countered by playing rock more often, as it beats scissors and ties with rock.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie, with a tendency to play scissors frequently. This can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie, and considering their tendency to play scissors frequently, the opponent played scissors in the last round and won. Therefore, they are likely to repeat their move and play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round, my best counter-move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: The consistent theme in the previous hypotheses is that the opponent tends to play scissors frequently and switches their move after a loss or tie. They also repeat their move after a win. This pattern has been observed multiple times and has been exploited by playing rock, which counters scissors.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins with Rock**: There are several instances where playing rock has resulted in a win against scissors (e.g., rounds 177, 183, 188, 193, 196, 201, 203, 208, 212, 217, 221, 225). This suggests a frequent occurrence of the opponent playing scissors.
   - **Losses and Ties**: When the opponent loses or ties, they tend to switch their move. However, the switch is not always predictable, but the tendency to play scissors remains high.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: The opponent's strategy seems to involve a high frequency of playing scissors, with occasional switches after losses or ties. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

4. **Exploitation Strategy**: Given the frequent success of playing rock, it seems the opponent's strategy can be exploited by continuing to play rock, as it counters their frequent choice of scissors.

5. **Positive Reward with Rock**: The consistent positive reward when playing rock indicates that the opponent may be playing a static strategy with a high frequency of scissors.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations: the opponent frequently plays scissors and switches after losses or ties, but not in a perfectly predictable manner. Playing rock has been an effective counter-strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, repeats their move after a win, and switches after a loss or tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but can be exploited by playing rock more often.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of frequently playing scissors and switching after a loss, they lost the last round when they played scissors against my rock. Therefore, it is likely they will switch from scissors to another move. Given their pattern, they might switch to rock or paper. However, since they often play scissors, they might still play it again. To be safe, I will predict they might switch to rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent might play rock, my best counter would be to play paper, which beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, which is evident from the number of times I won by playing rock.
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win, as seen in rounds where they played the same move consecutively after winning.
   - After a loss or tie, the opponent often switches their move, which aligns with the observed pattern of them changing their play after losing to my rock or paper.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - There is a noted preference for playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock more often.
   - The opponent's strategy is not perfectly consistent but follows a recognizable pattern.

3. **Current Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent's strategy involves repeating their move after a win and switching to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie.
   - They have a tendency to play scissors frequently, which suggests a bias that can be exploited by playing rock more often.
   - This pattern is not perfectly consistent, but it provides a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, indicating that the opponent's frequent use of scissors can be exploited.
   - Playing paper has also been effective when predicting the opponent's switch to rock after a loss or tie.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy can be countered by playing rock more frequently, especially after observing a pattern of scissors plays.
   - Additionally, playing paper can be effective when anticipating the opponent's switch to rock after a loss or tie.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, repeats their move after a win, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but can be exploited by playing rock more often.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win and switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or tie. In the last round, they played rock and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch to scissors, which would beat my last play of paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.7442288741359167, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win, switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switch to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and won. According to their pattern, they are likely to repeat 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {207: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.27467214832659914, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 168: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {207: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.27467214832659914, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 168: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.19738719072715372, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - At round 207, the hypothesis was that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie.
   - At round 168, the hypothesis was similar but slightly less specific, suggesting the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - The opponent played 'rock' in the last round (229) resulting in a tie.
   - Before that, the opponent played 'paper' (round 227) and 'scissors' (round 228), indicating a switch after a loss and a win.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - After a win (round 228), the opponent switched from 'scissors' to 'rock'.
   - After a loss (round 227), the opponent switched from 'paper' to 'scissors'.
   - After a tie (round 229), the opponent's next move is yet to be observed, but based on the hypothesis, they might switch to a move that beats 'rock', which is 'paper'.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing 'rock' has resulted in a mix of outcomes: wins against 'scissors', losses against 'paper', and ties against 'rock'.
   - Playing 'scissors' has generally been successful against 'paper'.
   - Playing 'paper' has been effective against 'rock'.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern where they switch to a move that would beat their last move after a loss or a tie, and they might repeat their move after a win. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Based on this analysis, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next, as they tied with 'rock' in the last round. To counter this, I should play 'scissors'.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches to a move that would beat their last move after a loss, and switches to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to switch to a move that would beat their last move after a tie. In the last round, both of us played 'rock', resulting in a tie. Therefore, the opponent is likely to switch to 'paper' to beat 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my best counter-move would be 'scissors' to beat their 'paper'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {65: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and frequently plays scissors. This can be exploited by playing rock more often.', 'value': 0.09902363762999994, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

Top hypotheses: {65: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and frequently plays scissors. This can be exploited by playing rock more often.', 'value': 0.09902363762999994, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypothesis:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss or tie, and frequently plays scissors. This hypothesis was based on the observation that the opponent often plays scissors, and switching after a loss or tie suggests a pattern of adaptation.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: When I played scissors against paper, rock against scissors, and paper against rock, I won. This suggests that the opponent does not consistently counter my moves effectively.
   - **Losses**: When I played paper against scissors, scissors against rock, and rock against paper, I lost. This indicates that the opponent sometimes plays the counter move.
   - **Ties**: There have been several ties, particularly when both played the same move (e.g., scissors vs. scissors, rock vs. rock).

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, as noted in the hypothesis.
   - After a tie, the opponent seems to switch moves, as seen in the ties followed by different moves.
   - After a win or loss, the opponent's next move is less predictable, but there is a tendency to play scissors often.

4. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - The opponent's frequent use of scissors suggests a bias towards this move.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent switches after a tie seems consistent with the data.
   - The opponent's strategy might not be highly adaptive but rather follows a pattern of frequent scissors use and switching after ties.

5. **Exploitation Strategy**:
   - Given the frequent use of scissors, playing rock more often could be beneficial.
   - After a tie, anticipate a switch and choose a move that counters the likely switch.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors and switches moves after a tie. This can be exploited by playing rock more often and anticipating a switch after ties.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of frequently playing scissors and switching moves after a tie, and considering the last round ended in a tie with both playing scissors, it is likely that the opponent will switch from scissors. Based on their pattern, they might switch to rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent might play rock, my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {79: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {79: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see if there are any patterns:

1. **Wins and Losses:**
   - When I play rock, I often win against scissors. This suggests the opponent frequently plays scissors.
   - When I play paper, I win against rock and lose against scissors. This indicates the opponent switches between rock and scissors.
   - When I play scissors, I win against paper and lose against rock. This suggests the opponent also plays paper.

2. **Ties:**
   - Ties occur when both play the same move. There have been ties with rock, paper, and scissors, indicating the opponent doesn't stick to one move consistently.

3. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent seems to switch their move after a loss or tie, but they might repeat their move after a win. This is consistent with the previous hypothesis.
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, as evidenced by my frequent wins with rock.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie. They have a tendency to play scissors more often, which can be exploited by playing rock.

5. **Static Strategy:**
   - The opponent doesn't seem to adapt to my strategy, as I consistently gain positive rewards by playing rock against their frequent scissors.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

This hypothesis suggests that I should continue playing rock more frequently to exploit the opponent's tendency to play scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing paper, the opponent is likely to switch from paper. Given their frequent play of scissors, it is likely they will play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

The opponent frequently plays rock after losing to paper.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {88: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. The opponent frequently plays rock after losing to paper.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see if any patterns emerge:

1. **After a Win**: 
   - Round 183: Opponent played scissors and lost to my rock. Next move: rock.

   - Round 217: Opponent played scissors and lost to my rock. Next move: paper.
   - Round 218: Opponent played rock and lost to my paper. Next move: paper.

   - Round 222: Opponent played rock and lost to my paper. Next move: paper.
   - Round 223: Opponent played paper and lost to my scissors. Next move: paper.
   - Round 225: Opponent played scissors and lost to my rock. Next move: paper.
   - Round 226: Opponent played rock and lost to my paper. Next move: paper.
   - Round 228: Opponent played paper and lost to my scissors. Next move: paper.

2. **After a Loss**:
   - Round 184: Opponent played rock and won against my scissors. Next move: rock.
   - Round 187: Opponent played scissors and won against my paper. Next move: rock.
   - Round 192: Opponent played scissors and won against my paper. Next move: paper.
   - Round 195: Opponent played scissors and won against my paper. Next move: rock.
   - Round 200: Opponent played scissors and won against my paper. Next move: rock.
   - Round 206: Opponent played paper and won against my rock. Next move: paper.
   - Round 210: Opponent played paper and won against my rock. Next move: paper.
   - Round 220: Opponent played scissors and won against my paper. Next move: rock.
   - Round 224: Opponent played scissors and won against my paper. Next move: rock.
   - Round 227: Opponent played paper and won against my rock. Next move: rock.

3. **After a Tie**:
   - Round 194: Opponent played paper and tied with my paper. Next move: scissors.
   - Round 197: Opponent played rock and tied with my rock. Next move: scissors.
   - Round 198: Opponent played scissors and tied with my scissors. Next move: rock.
   - Round 199: Opponent played rock and tied with my rock. Next move: paper.
   - Round 202: Opponent played rock and tied with my rock. Next move: rock.
   - Round 204: Opponent played rock and tied with my rock. Next move: scissors.
   - Round 205: Opponent played scissors and tied with my scissors. Next move: rock.
   - Round 229: Opponent played rock and tied with my rock. Next move: scissors.
   - Round 230: Opponent played scissors and tied with my scissors. Next move: paper.
   - Round 231: Opponent played paper and tied with my paper. Next move: rock.
   - Round 232: Opponent played rock and tied with my rock. Next move: scissors.

**Hypothesis**:
The opponent seems to follow a pattern where:
- After a win, they tend to repeat their move.
- After a loss, they switch to the move that would have beaten my last move.
- After a tie, they switch to the move that would beat their last move.

This hypothesis aligns with the interaction history, where the opponent often repeats their move after a win, switches to a counter move after a loss, and switches to a move that beats their last move after a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches to the move that would have beaten my last move. After a tie, the opponent switches to the move that would beat their last move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they switch to the move that would beat their last move. In the last round, both played 'rock', resulting in a tie. Therefore, the opponent is likely to play 'paper' next, as it beats 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', I should play 'scissors' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {79: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.13410000000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 91: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches their move after both wins and losses, and also after ties. They show a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 95: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, as observed in many rounds.
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - There are patterns where the opponent plays scissors multiple times in a row, suggesting a preference or bias towards scissors.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - In recent rounds, the opponent played scissors in rounds 230, 233, and paper in round 231, indicating a possible pattern of switching after ties.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to align with the hypothesis that they switch after a loss or tie and repeat after a win.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - This suggests that the opponent's frequent use of scissors can be exploited by consistently playing rock.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent likely repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.
   - They have a frequent inclination towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the previous hypotheses still hold strong, and the strategy of playing rock to counter the opponent's frequent scissors plays remains effective.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to switch from scissors. Based on their frequent play of scissors, they might switch to rock or paper. However, given their tendency to play scissors often, they might switch to rock to counter my scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely switch to rock, my best play would be paper, as it beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Wins and Losses:**
   - When I played 'paper' and won, the opponent played 'rock' (rounds 185, 190, 209, 213, 215, 218, 222, 226).
   - When I played 'scissors' and won, the opponent played 'paper' (rounds 186, 191, 207, 211, 214, 216, 219, 223, 228).
   - When I played 'rock' and won, the opponent played 'scissors' (rounds 188, 193, 196, 201, 203, 208, 212, 217, 221, 225).

2. **Ties:**
   - When I played 'paper', the opponent also played 'paper' (rounds 194, 231, 234).
   - When I played 'rock', the opponent also played 'rock' (rounds 197, 199, 202, 204, 229, 232).
   - When I played 'scissors', the opponent also played 'scissors' (rounds 198, 205, 230, 233).

3. **Losses:**
   - When I played 'paper' and lost, the opponent played 'scissors' (rounds 187, 195, 200, 220, 224).
   - When I played 'scissors' and lost, the opponent played 'rock' (rounds 189, 206, 210, 227).

From this analysis, it appears that the opponent is playing a static strategy where they consistently play the same move that I played in the previous round. This is evident from the pattern of ties and the consistent wins when I counter their repeated move.

**Hypothesis:**
The opponent seems to be playing a strategy where they mimic my last move. This explains the consistent ties and the pattern of wins and losses based on my previous move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent mimics my last move. They play the same move I played in the previous round.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent mimics my last move, and my last play was paper, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted play of paper, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {112: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent switches their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {112: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent switches their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and identify any patterns in their behavior:

1. **Wins, Losses, and Ties**:
   - When the opponent wins (e.g., they play rock against my scissors), they tend to switch their move in the next round.
   - When the opponent loses (e.g., they play scissors against my rock), they also tend to switch their move in the next round.
   - When the opponent ties (e.g., both play rock), they switch their move in the next round.

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to consistently switch their move regardless of the outcome (win, loss, or tie). This suggests a strategy where they avoid repeating the same move consecutively.

3. **Static Strategy**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a simple one where they never play the same move twice in a row. This could be a static strategy that doesn't adapt to my plays but rather follows a fixed pattern.

4. **Exploitation Strategy**:
   - Given this pattern, I can exploit it by predicting their next move based on their current move. If they play rock, I can expect them to switch to paper or scissors in the next round. By anticipating this switch, I can choose the move that beats their likely next move.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I've been getting positive rewards when I correctly anticipate their switch and play the counter move. For instance, when they play rock and I play paper, I win. This confirms that exploiting their switching pattern is beneficial.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is that the opponent switches their move after every round, regardless of the outcome. This allows me to predict their next move and choose the counter move accordingly.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches their move after every round, regardless of the outcome (win, loss, or tie).'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after every round, and considering their last play was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to play rock after winning with rock (e.g., rounds 235 and 236).
   - The opponent has also played rock after ties (e.g., rounds 229 and 232).
   - There are instances where the opponent switches moves after a loss (e.g., round 206 to 207, where they switched from paper to scissors).

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The previous hypotheses suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches their move after a loss, and switches their move after a tie.
   - The opponent shows a slight preference for playing rock after losing to paper or after ties.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - The opponent's recent plays (rounds 235 and 236) indicate a preference for repeating rock after winning with it.
   - The opponent has not consistently switched moves after losses, but there is a pattern of switching after ties.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially against scissors.
   - Playing paper against rock has also been successful.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent likely follows a strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. They have a preference for playing rock, especially after ties or losses to paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move. The opponent shows a preference for playing rock after ties or losses to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. Since they won the last round with 'rock', it is likely they will play 'rock' again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

The opponent shows a preference for playing rock after ties or losses to paper.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent seems to switch their move after a loss. For example, in round 189, they played rock after losing with scissors in round 188.
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their move. For instance, in round 190, they played rock again after winning with rock in round 189.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For example, in round 197, they played rock after tying with rock in round 196.
   - The opponent shows a preference for playing rock after ties or losses to paper. This is evident in rounds 227 and 237, where they played rock after losing to paper.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.
   - There is a noted preference for playing rock after ties or losses to paper.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing paper has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays rock, which aligns with their tendency to play rock after ties or losses to paper.

Based on this analysis, the previous hypothesis seems to explain the data well. The opponent's strategy involves repeating moves after wins, switching after losses, and switching after ties, with a preference for playing rock after ties or losses to paper.

Given this understanding, the optimal strategy would be to continue playing paper, as it counters the opponent's tendency to play rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move. The opponent shows a preference for playing rock after ties or losses to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and won against their rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. Since they lost with rock, they are likely to switch to paper, as they have shown a preference for playing rock after ties or losses to paper. However, given the pattern, they might switch to scissors to counter my paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors to counter my paper, my best play would be rock to beat their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.5541, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 124: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.5541, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {123: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.5541, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 124: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.5541, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see if the previous hypothesis still holds or if it needs refinement.

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent's strategy was hypothesized as follows:
   - After a win, the opponent repeats their move.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

2. **Recent Interaction Analysis**:
   - **Round 237**: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won. 
     - Next round (238), opponent played paper, which is a switch from rock.
   - **Round 236**: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost.
     - Next round (237), opponent played rock again, which is a repeat.
   - **Round 235**: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost.
     - Next round (236), opponent played rock again, which is a repeat.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - After winning (round 237), the opponent switched from rock to paper.
   - After losing (rounds 235 and 236), the opponent repeated rock.
   - This aligns with the hypothesis that after a win, the opponent switches, and after a loss, they repeat.

4. **Hypothesis Validation**:
   - The hypothesis seems to hold well with the recent rounds, as the opponent's behavior is consistent with switching after a win and repeating after a loss.

5. **Strategy Implication**:
   - If the opponent repeats their move after a loss, I should play the move that beats their last move.
   - If the opponent switches after a win, I should anticipate the switch and play the move that beats the likely switch.

Given this analysis, the previous hypothesis still explains the opponent's behavior well. Therefore, I will continue to use it to inform my strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent won with paper against my rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of paper, my best move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the previous hypotheses:

1. **Observation of Patterns:**
   - The opponent tends to switch their move after a loss and a tie.
   - After a win, the opponent repeats their move.
   - There is a noted preference for playing rock after ties or losses to paper.

2. **Analysis of Recent Rounds:**
   - In round 238, the opponent played paper after losing with rock in round 237, which aligns with the hypothesis of switching after a loss.
   - In round 239, the opponent played paper again after losing with paper in round 238, which suggests a switch from rock to paper after a loss to paper.

3. **Consistency with Hypotheses:**
   - The opponent's behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that they switch moves after a loss or tie and repeat after a win.
   - The preference for playing rock after ties or losses to paper is also observed, as seen in previous rounds.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing scissors has often resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent is predicted to play paper.
   - This suggests that the opponent's strategy can be exploited by predicting their next move based on the observed pattern.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a combination of switching moves after losses and ties, with a preference for rock after ties or losses to paper.
   - This strategy can be countered effectively by anticipating their next move and playing the counter move.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy remains consistent with previous observations and can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move. The opponent shows a preference for playing rock after ties or losses to paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played paper and I played scissors), they are likely to switch their move. Given their preference for playing rock after losses to paper, it is likely they will play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.781509, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.9742947523409999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch from 'paper' to 'scissors' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', my best counter-move would be to play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.991183100052963, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch from 'paper' to 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter-move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {124: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.39382817003707404, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 180: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a loss or a tie. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors. This preference for scissors can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses.

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - **Hypothesis 1**: After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.
   - **Hypothesis 2**: The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a loss or a tie. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - The opponent played scissors in round 250 after winning with scissors in round 249.
   - In rounds where I played rock, I often received positive rewards, indicating the opponent played scissors frequently.
   - The opponent seems to switch moves after a loss or a tie, but there is a noticeable preference for scissors.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent tends to play scissors frequently, especially after a loss or a tie.
   - When I play rock, I often win, suggesting the opponent's preference for scissors.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to align more with Hypothesis 2, where they have a preference for scissors and switch moves after a loss or tie.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a preference for scissors, especially after a loss or tie. This can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.
   - The opponent switches moves after a loss or tie but often returns to scissors.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit the opponent's preference for scissors by playing rock more frequently.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a loss or a tie.
   - There are instances where the opponent switches moves after a loss or a tie but often chooses scissors.
   - The opponent's behavior seems to be somewhat predictable with a tendency towards playing scissors.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - Hypotheses suggest that the opponent often plays scissors, particularly after a loss or a tie.
   - The opponent may repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie.
   - The value associated with these hypotheses indicates a moderate level of confidence in predicting the opponent's next move as scissors.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing rock has consistently yielded positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - This suggests that the opponent's strategy might be static or not adaptive, allowing exploitation by frequently playing rock.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a preference for scissors, especially after a loss or a tie.
   - This can be exploited by playing rock more frequently, as it has consistently resulted in positive rewards.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a loss or a tie. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors. This preference for scissors can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to play scissors frequently, especially after a loss or a tie, and considering that they lost the last round with scissors against my rock, it is likely they will switch their move. However, since they often revert to scissors, I predict they might play scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted scissors play by the opponent, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.7029758033181663, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': According to the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they switch their move. In the last round, both of us played rock, resulting in a tie. Therefore, I predict that the opponent will switch from rock to paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play paper, my best counter-move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {180: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a loss or a tie. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors. This preference for scissors can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.26787, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 251: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a loss or a tie. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors. This preference for scissors can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 124: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.19208306232271644, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 252: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a loss or a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

   - The opponent has shown a tendency to play scissors frequently, especially after a loss or a tie. 
   - There are several instances where the opponent repeated the same move after a tie (e.g., rounds 205, 230, 233, 253).
   - The opponent seems to switch moves after a loss but often chooses scissors (e.g., rounds 206 to 207, 210 to 211, 220 to 221, 224 to 225, 227 to 228, 235 to 237).
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move (e.g., rounds 209 to 210, 215 to 216).

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The most consistent hypothesis is that the opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a loss or a tie. This has been observed multiple times and aligns with the interaction history.
   - Another hypothesis suggests that after a win, the opponent repeats their move, and after a loss or a tie, they switch moves.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - There are instances where playing rock resulted in a tie (e.g., rounds 204, 229, 252), but these are neutral outcomes.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to heavily favor playing scissors, particularly after a loss or a tie. This can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent switches moves after a loss or a tie but often chooses scissors is consistent with the observed data.

Based on this analysis, the most fitting hypothesis is that the opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a loss or a tie. This strategy can be countered effectively by playing rock more often.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after a loss or a tie. They switch moves after a loss or a tie but often choose scissors. This preference for scissors can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to play scissors frequently, especially after a tie, it is likely that they will play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {124: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.4344581436259015, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {124: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.4344581436259015, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and see if any patterns emerge:

1. **Wins, Losses, and Ties:**
   - When I win (e.g., round 207, 208, 209), the opponent tends to switch their move.
   - When I lose (e.g., round 206, 210, 227), the opponent tends to repeat their move.
   - When there's a tie (e.g., round 205, 230, 233), the opponent tends to switch their move.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - After a win for me, the opponent switches their move.
   - After a loss for me, the opponent repeats their move.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

3. **Testing the Hypothesis:**
   - This pattern seems consistent with the previous hypothesis: "After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move."
   - However, based on the current data, it seems more accurate to say: "After a win for me, the opponent switches their move. After a loss for me, the opponent repeats their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move."

4. **Strategy Adjustment:**
   - If this hypothesis holds, I can exploit this by predicting the opponent's next move based on the outcome of the previous round:
     - If I win, I should play the move that beats the opponent's likely switch.
     - If I lose, I should play the move that beats the opponent's repeated move.
     - If there's a tie, I should play the move that beats the opponent's switch.

5. **Reward Analysis:**
   - I am getting positive rewards when I anticipate the opponent's switch or repeat correctly.

Based on this analysis, here's the refined hypothesis:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win for me, the opponent switches their move. After a loss for me, the opponent repeats their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss for me, the opponent repeats their move. Since I lost the last round with rock against their paper, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {124: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.004120700538131017, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see if there is a pattern in their plays:

1. **Wins, Losses, and Ties:**
   - When the opponent wins (e.g., when they play paper against my rock), they tend to repeat the winning move or switch to another move.
   - When the opponent loses (e.g., when they play scissors against my rock), they might switch their move.
   - When there is a tie (e.g., both play rock), they seem to switch their move.

2. **Recent Patterns:**
   - From rounds 229 to 234, there were consecutive ties, and the opponent switched their move each time.
   - In rounds 235 and 236, the opponent played rock twice after winning against my scissors.
   - In round 237, after losing with rock against my paper, they switched to paper in round 238.

3. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern where after a win, they might repeat the winning move or switch to another move. After a loss, they switch their move. After a tie, they switch their move.
   - This is consistent with the previous hypothesis, but with a slight modification that after a win, they might not always repeat the move.

4. **Static Strategy Possibility:**
   - The opponent might be using a strategy that involves switching moves frequently, especially after ties and losses, which makes it seem like they are trying to avoid being predictable.

5. **Exploitation Strategy:**
   - Given the pattern, I can exploit this by anticipating their switch after ties and losses. If they won with a move, I should be cautious as they might repeat it or switch.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent might repeat their move or switch to another move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they might repeat their move or switch. Since they won the last round with 'rock', they might repeat 'rock' or switch. Given their tendency to switch after a tie or loss, it's more likely they will repeat 'rock' after a win.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to switch their move after a loss. For example, when they played rock and lost to paper, they often switched to another move.
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move or switches to another move. This behavior is not perfectly consistent.
   - After a tie, the opponent tends to switch their move.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The opponent might repeat their move after a win or switch to another move.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - The opponent's behavior seems to align with the hypothesis that they switch moves after a loss and sometimes after a tie.
   - The opponent's move after a win is less predictable, as they might repeat or switch.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing paper has often resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent played rock.
   - The strategy of playing paper seems to counter the opponent's frequent choice of rock effectively.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: "After a win, the opponent might repeat their move or switch to another move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move."

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the observed data. The opponent's strategy involves switching moves after a loss or tie, with some unpredictability after a win.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent might repeat their move or switch to another move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, I played paper and won against their rock. According to the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. Therefore, the opponent is likely to switch from rock to scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {124: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.5120191432636843, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 256: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent might repeat their move or switch to another move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they seem to repeat their move. For example:
   - Round 210: Opponent wins with paper against my rock, and in round 211, they play paper again.
   - Round 220: Opponent wins with scissors against my paper, and in round 221, they play scissors again.

2. **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they tend to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 208: Opponent loses with scissors against my rock, and in round 209, they switch to rock.
   - Round 237: Opponent loses with rock against my paper, and in round 238, they switch to paper.

3. **Ties**: When there is a tie, the opponent switches their move. For example:
   - Round 229: Tie with rock, and in round 230, they switch to scissors.
   - Round 231: Tie with paper, and in round 232, they switch to rock.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:
- After a win, the opponent repeats their move.
- After a loss, the opponent switches their move.
- After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

This strategy aligns well with the previous hypotheses and the observed data. The opponent's behavior appears to be consistent with this pattern, allowing us to predict their next move based on the outcome of the previous round.

Given this understanding, the optimal counter-strategy would be to anticipate the opponent's next move based on the outcome of the previous round and play the move that beats it.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they won with paper against my rock), they are likely to repeat their move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my best move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: 
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This pattern has been observed consistently across multiple hypotheses.
   - The opponent's behavior is not perfectly consistent, but the tendency to repeat after a win and switch after a loss or tie is a reasonable approximation.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: When the opponent loses (e.g., when I play paper and they play rock), they tend to switch their move in the next round.
   - **Losses**: When the opponent wins (e.g., when I play rock and they play paper), they tend to repeat their move in the next round.
   - **Ties**: When there is a tie (e.g., both play rock), the opponent tends to switch their move in the next round.

3. **Pattern Consistency**:
   - The pattern of repeating after a win and switching after a loss or tie is consistent with the observed data. This aligns with the hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play the counter to the opponent's predicted move based on the above pattern. For example, playing scissors when predicting the opponent will play paper.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: "After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move."

Based on this analysis, the strategy to counter the opponent is to predict their next move using the identified pattern and play the counter move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (opponent played paper and lost to my scissors), they are likely to switch their move. Therefore, if they switch from paper, their next play is likely to be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {124: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.1608893801992053, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 256: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent might repeat their move or switch to another move.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to switch moves after a loss, as seen in rounds 210, 227, 235, 236, 238, 254, and 257.
   - After a win, the opponent sometimes repeats their move, as seen in rounds 220, 224, 250, and 259, where they played scissors after winning with scissors.
   - After a tie, the opponent tends to switch moves, as seen in rounds 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, and 252.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - Hypothesis 1 (Round 124): The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.
   - Hypothesis 2 (Round 256): The opponent might repeat or switch after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.
   - Hypothesis 3 (Round 204): The opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and repeats their move after a win.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - The opponent's behavior aligns with the first hypothesis, where they switch after a loss and sometimes repeat after a win.
   - The opponent's tendency to play scissors after a win or tie suggests a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be: switch after a loss, repeat or switch after a win, and switch after a tie. There is a noticeable bias towards playing scissors, especially after a win or tie.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move or switches to another move, often favoring scissors. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': In the last round, the opponent played scissors and won. Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they tend to repeat their move or switch to another move, often favoring scissors. Therefore, it is likely that the opponent will play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they seem to repeat their move or switch to another move, often favoring scissors. This is evident from rounds where they won, and the subsequent move was often scissors.

2. **Losses**: After a loss, the opponent tends to switch their move. This is consistent with the hypothesis that after losing, they don't repeat the same move.

3. **Ties**: After a tie, the opponent also switches their move. This behavior is consistent with the hypothesis that they don't repeat the same move after a tie.

4. **Bias towards Scissors**: There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent frequently plays scissors, especially after losing or tying. This suggests a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently.

5. **Static Strategy**: Given the consistent positive reward when playing rock, it appears the opponent may be playing a static strategy that can be countered effectively by consistently playing rock.

Based on these observations, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

- **After a win**: The opponent repeats their move or switches to another move, often favoring scissors.
- **After a loss**: The opponent switches their move.
- **After a tie**: The opponent switches their move.
- **Bias**: There is a noticeable bias towards playing scissors, especially after losing or tying.

Given this analysis, the best counter-strategy is to continue playing rock, as it has consistently yielded positive rewards.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move or switches to another move, often favoring scissors. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move. There is a noticeable bias towards playing scissors, especially after losing or tying.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing (as they did in the last round), they tend to switch their move. Given their bias towards playing scissors, especially after losing, it is likely they will switch to scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {260: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move or switches to another move, often favoring scissors. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.48750899999999997, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 258: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.4659, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This pattern has been observed with some consistency.
   - The opponent often favors scissors after a win or a tie.
   - The hypotheses have predicted the opponent's next play to be 'rock' with a suggestion for me to play 'paper'.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: When I win, the opponent tends to switch their move. For example, after I played 'rock' and won against 'scissors', the opponent switched to 'rock' or 'paper'.
   - **Losses**: When I lose, the opponent tends to repeat their move. For instance, when I played 'paper' and lost to 'scissors', the opponent often repeated 'scissors'.
   - **Ties**: After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For example, after a tie with 'rock', the opponent switched to 'scissors' or 'paper'.

3. **Static Strategy Consideration**:
   - There is a pattern where the opponent favors 'scissors' after a win or a tie, suggesting a potential bias towards 'scissors' in certain situations.
   - My positive rewards have often come from playing 'rock' against 'scissors' and 'paper' against 'rock', indicating the opponent's tendency to switch to 'scissors' or 'rock' after certain outcomes.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a mix of repeating moves after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, with a bias towards 'scissors' in some cases.
   - This strategy is not perfectly consistent but provides a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Based on this analysis, my strategy should focus on exploiting the opponent's tendency to switch moves after a tie or a loss and their bias towards 'scissors'.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move or switches to another move, often favoring scissors. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to switch their move. Since the last round ended in a tie with both playing rock, the opponent is likely to switch from rock. Given their tendency to favor scissors, it is likely they will play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {260: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move or switches to another move, often favoring scissors. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.6412563, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 262: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move or switches to another move, often favoring scissors. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 204: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and repeats their move after a win.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

To determine my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - My opponent tends to play scissors frequently, especially after losses or ties.
   - After a win, the opponent either repeats their move or switches, often favoring scissors.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent often favors scissors after losing or tying.
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win or switches to another move, often favoring scissors.
   - These patterns suggest a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have been receiving positive rewards when playing rock, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - This indicates that the opponent's strategy is somewhat predictable and can be countered effectively by playing rock.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating moves after a win and switching moves after a loss or tie, with a bias towards scissors.
   - This suggests that the opponent is not adapting significantly to my strategy and is likely following a static or semi-static policy.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is that the opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and repeats their move after a win. This suggests a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move or switches to another move, often favoring scissors. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move. The opponent has a bias towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing with scissors in the last round, they are likely to switch their move. Given their bias towards playing scissors, they might switch to rock or paper. However, considering their tendency to favor scissors, they might switch to rock to counter my consistent rock plays.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's potential switch to rock, my best play would be paper, as it beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move or switches to another move, often favoring scissors. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.882351, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move or switches to another move, often favoring scissors. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.882351, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they tend to switch their move. In the last round, they played rock and lost. Therefore, it is likely they will switch to another move. Given their tendency to favor scissors, it is probable that they will play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {260: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move or switches to another move, often favoring scissors. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.31764570000000003, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.019865637629999988, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {260: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move or switches to another move, often favoring scissors. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.31764570000000003, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Observation of Patterns:**
   - After a win, the opponent seems to either repeat their move or switch to another move, often favoring scissors.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

2. **Recent History Analysis:**
   - From rounds 217 to 266, there are several instances where the opponent's behavior aligns with the hypothesis:
     - After winning with paper against my rock in round 266, the opponent might switch or repeat their move.
     - After losing, the opponent tends to switch their move.
     - After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

3. **Consistency Check:**
   - The hypothesis from round 260 seems to explain the opponent's behavior well, as it accounts for the opponent's tendency to favor scissors after a win and switch moves after a loss or tie.

4. **Static Strategy Check:**
   - When I play rock, I often get a positive reward, suggesting the opponent might favor scissors or switch to a move that loses to rock after certain conditions.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating moves after a win or favoring scissors, switching moves after a loss, and switching after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but provides a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis from round 260 remains valid and explains the data observed so far.

    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move or switches to another move, often favoring scissors. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after winning with paper against my rock in the last round, they might repeat their move or switch to another move. Given their tendency to favor scissors after a win, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted scissors play by the opponent, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.313905946341, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 258: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.21052166910000003, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their behavior based on the interaction history:

1. **After a Win:**
   - Round 218: Opponent played 'rock', lost, switched to 'paper'.

   - Round 235: Opponent played 'rock', won, repeated 'rock'.
   - Round 236: Opponent played 'rock', won, repeated 'rock'.
   - Round 237: Opponent played 'rock', lost, switched to 'paper'.
   - Round 238: Opponent played 'paper', won, repeated 'paper'.
   - Round 239: Opponent played 'paper', lost, switched to 'scissors'.
   - Round 240: Opponent played 'scissors', won, repeated 'scissors'.
   - Round 241: Opponent played 'scissors', lost, switched to 'rock'.
   - Round 242: Opponent played 'rock', lost, switched to 'paper'.
   - Round 243: Opponent played 'paper', lost, switched to 'scissors'.
   - Round 244: Opponent played 'scissors', lost, switched to 'rock'.
   - Round 245: Opponent played 'rock', lost, switched to 'paper'.
   - Round 246: Opponent played 'paper', lost, switched to 'scissors'.
   - Round 247: Opponent played 'scissors', lost, switched to 'rock'.
   - Round 248: Opponent played 'rock', lost, switched to 'paper'.
   - Round 249: Opponent played 'paper', lost, switched to 'scissors'.
   - Round 250: Opponent played 'scissors', won, repeated 'scissors'.
   - Round 251: Opponent played 'scissors', lost, switched to 'rock'.
   - Round 252: Opponent played 'rock', tied, switched to 'scissors'.
   - Round 253: Opponent played 'scissors', tied, switched to 'paper'.
   - Round 254: Opponent played 'paper', won, repeated 'paper'.
   - Round 255: Opponent played 'paper', lost, switched to 'rock'.
   - Round 256: Opponent played 'rock', lost, switched to 'paper'.
   - Round 257: Opponent played 'paper', won, repeated 'paper'.
   - Round 258: Opponent played 'paper', lost, switched to 'scissors'.
   - Round 259: Opponent played 'scissors', won, repeated 'scissors'.
   - Round 260: Opponent played 'scissors', lost, switched to 'rock'.
   - Round 261: Opponent played 'rock', tied, switched to 'scissors'.
   - Round 262: Opponent played 'scissors', lost, switched to 'rock'.
   - Round 263: Opponent played 'rock', lost, switched to 'paper'.
   - Round 264: Opponent played 'paper', lost, switched to 'rock'.
   - Round 265: Opponent played 'rock', lost, switched to 'paper'.
   - Round 266: Opponent played 'paper', won, repeated 'paper'.
   - Round 267: Opponent played 'paper', won, repeated 'paper'.

2. **After a Loss:**
   - The opponent consistently switches their move after a loss.

3. **After a Tie:**
   - The opponent switches their move after a tie.

From this analysis, the opponent's strategy appears to be:
- After a win, the opponent repeats their move.
- After a loss, the opponent switches their move.
- After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

This strategy is consistent with the previous hypotheses, and the opponent seems to follow this pattern quite reliably.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. In the last round, they played paper and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

Exploit by playing the counter to their last move.', 'value': 0.155709, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to have a pattern where they often repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. This is evident from several rounds where they repeated their move after winning (e.g., rounds 220, 224, 238) and switched after losing (e.g., rounds 221, 225, 239).
   - There are instances where the opponent's behavior deviates slightly, but the overall trend supports the hypothesis of repeating after a win and switching after a loss or tie.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The hypotheses from rounds 205, 258, and 268 suggest a similar pattern: the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This pattern has been consistent across multiple rounds, although not perfectly.
   - The hypothesis from round 200 suggests the opponent tends to repeat their move regardless of the outcome, but this is less consistent with the observed data.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When playing scissors, I have often received positive rewards, especially when predicting the opponent will play paper. This suggests that the opponent frequently plays paper, which aligns with the hypothesis that they repeat their move after a win.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The most consistent hypothesis is that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This strategy has been observed in multiple rounds and aligns with the interaction history.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit this pattern by predicting the opponent's next move and playing the counter strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (opponent played paper, I played scissors), they are likely to switch their move. Therefore, their next play is likely to be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

Top hypotheses: {206: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and often repeats scissors after winning with it. This suggests a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.06381391370709, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 258: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.013155617859000046, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and see if there are any patterns:

1. **Wins and Repeats**: The opponent often repeats their move after winning. For example, in round 221, they played scissors after winning with scissors in round 220. This pattern is consistent with rounds 225-226 and 241-242.

2. **Losses and Switching**: After a loss, the opponent tends to switch their move. For instance, in round 224, they lost with scissors and switched to rock in round 225. Similarly, in round 238, they lost with paper and switched to scissors in round 239.

3. **Ties and Switching**: After a tie, the opponent also tends to switch their move. For example, in round 229, they tied with rock and switched to scissors in round 230. This pattern is also seen in rounds 231-232 and 233-234.

4. **Bias Towards Scissors**: There seems to be a slight bias towards playing scissors, especially after ties or losses. This is evident from rounds 220, 224, 230, 233, 240, 250, and 259, where scissors was played frequently.

5. **Static Strategy**: The opponent's strategy appears to be somewhat static, with a preference for repeating moves after wins and switching after losses or ties. This suggests a predictable pattern that can be exploited.

**Conclusion**: The opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows: they repeat their move after a win, switch their move after a loss, and switch their move after a tie. There is a noticeable bias towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. There is a noticeable bias towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie, and given that they won the last round with scissors, they are likely to repeat their move. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches their move after every round, regardless of the outcome (win, loss, or tie).'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {268: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Wins, Losses, and Ties**:
   - Wins: I win when I play rock against scissors, paper against rock, and scissors against paper.
   - Losses: I lose when I play rock against paper, paper against scissors, and scissors against rock.
   - Ties: Occur when both play the same move.

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - After a win: The opponent seems to switch their move. For example, after I won with rock against scissors (round 221), they played rock in the next round (222).
   - After a loss: The opponent seems to switch their move. For example, after losing with scissors against rock (round 225), they played paper in the next round (226).
   - After a tie: The opponent seems to switch their move. For example, after a tie with rock (round 229), they played scissors in the next round (230).

3. **Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent switches their move after every round, regardless of the outcome (win, loss, or tie). This is consistent with the observed pattern where the opponent does not repeat the same move consecutively.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play rock against scissors, paper against rock, and scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play rock against paper, paper against scissors, and scissors against rock.
   - Ties result in zero reward.

5. **Strategy**:
   - Given the opponent's tendency to switch moves, I can predict their next move based on their current move and choose the counter strategy accordingly.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches their move after every round, regardless of the outcome (win, loss, or tie).'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after every round, and considering their last play was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {206: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and often repeats scissors after winning with it. This suggests a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently.', 'value': 0.13410000000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern is not perfectly consistent but is a reasonable approximation of their behavior.', 'value': 0.12126881771647402, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 258: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.09644625275091007, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and often repeats scissors after winning with it. This suggests a bias towards scissors.
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie.

2. **Interaction History**:
   - There are multiple instances where the opponent plays scissors, especially after ties and losses.
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win, as seen in rounds where they won with rock or paper and repeated those moves.
   - After a tie, the opponent often switches their move, but there are exceptions.

3. **Current Observations**:
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to play scissors frequently, especially after ties or losses.
   - When the opponent wins, they often repeat the winning move.
   - After a tie, the opponent sometimes switches, but not consistently.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - Playing paper has also been effective when the opponent plays rock.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to have a bias towards playing scissors, especially after ties or losses.
   - They repeat their move after a win, which can be exploited by predicting their next move based on their last winning move.
   - The strategy of playing rock consistently can exploit their bias towards scissors.

Based on the above observations, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent frequently plays scissors after losing or tying, and often repeats their winning move. This suggests a bias towards scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock consistently. After a win, they tend to repeat the winning move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to play scissors after a tie or loss, and considering the last round ended in a tie with both playing scissors, it is likely that the opponent will play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted scissors play by the opponent, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {268: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

            You last played: rock

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {268: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and see if there are any patterns in their plays:

1. **Wins and Losses:**
   - When the opponent wins (e.g., when they play paper against my rock), they tend to repeat their move. For instance, in rounds 266 and 267, they played paper after winning with paper.
   - When the opponent loses (e.g., when they play scissors against my rock), they tend to switch their move. For example, in round 260, they played scissors and lost, then switched to rock in round 261.

2. **Ties:**
   - When there is a tie, the opponent seems to switch their move. For instance, in round 229, both played rock, and the opponent switched to scissors in round 230.

3. **Static Strategy:**
   - The opponent doesn't seem to be playing a static strategy, as they switch moves based on the outcome of the previous round.

4. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be: 
     - After a win, repeat the same move.
     - After a loss, switch to a different move.
     - After a tie, switch to a different move.

5. **My Rewards:**
   - I receive positive rewards when I correctly predict their switch or repeat behavior. For example, playing rock against their scissors or paper against their rock.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy aligns with my previous hypothesis. They repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: The consistent hypothesis across multiple rounds is that the opponent repeats their move after a win, switches after a loss, and switches after a tie. This pattern has been observed with varying confidence levels but seems to be a reasonable approximation of their behavior.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: When I win, the opponent tends to switch their move. For example, in round 273, I played scissors and won against their paper. If they follow the pattern, they should switch from paper.
   - **Losses**: When I lose, the opponent tends to repeat their move. For instance, in round 272, I played rock and lost to their paper. They repeated paper in the next round.
   - **Ties**: When there's a tie, the opponent switches their move. This is consistent with the hypothesis.

3. **Static Strategy Consideration**: The opponent does not seem to be playing a static strategy, as their moves change based on the outcome of the previous round.

4. **Exploiting the Pattern**: Given the hypothesis, I can exploit this by predicting their next move based on the outcome of the previous round. If they lost, they will switch; if they won, they will repeat.

5. **Current Strategy**: Based on the last round (273), where I won with scissors against their paper, they are likely to switch from paper to rock. Therefore, I should play paper in the next round to counter their expected rock.

In summary, the opponent's strategy appears to be a reactive one, where they adjust their move based on the outcome of the previous round. This allows me to predict their next move and choose the counter strategy accordingly.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played paper and I played scissors), they are likely to switch their move. Therefore, their next play is likely to be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {232: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.363, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 268: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.011003700000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and look for patterns:

1. **Wins and Losses:**
   - After winning with scissors against paper (round 274), the opponent previously played scissors again (round 235, 236).
   - After losing with rock against paper (round 237), the opponent switched to paper (round 238).
   - After losing with paper against scissors (round 239), the opponent switched to scissors (round 240).
   - After losing with rock against paper (round 242), the opponent switched to paper (round 243).

2. **Ties:**
   - After a tie with rock (round 229), the opponent played scissors (round 230).
   - After a tie with scissors (round 230), the opponent played paper (round 231).
   - After a tie with paper (round 234), the opponent played rock (round 235).

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

4. **Static Strategy:**
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

5. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially against the opponent's frequent scissors plays.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie. They have a tendency to play scissors more often, which can be exploited by playing rock.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win. In the last round, they won with scissors against my paper. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted scissors play by the opponent, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to frequently play scissors, as noted in previous hypotheses.
   - The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie.

2. **Recent Rounds Analysis**:
   - In rounds where I played rock, I often received a positive reward, especially when the opponent played scissors.
   - The opponent's behavior of frequently playing scissors can be exploited by consistently playing rock.

3. **Hypotheses Evaluation**:
   - The hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie aligns well with the observed data.
   - The consistent prediction of the opponent playing scissors and the suggestion to play rock has been effective.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially against the opponent's frequent scissors play.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve a tendency to play scissors frequently, and they switch moves after a loss or tie. This can be exploited by playing rock consistently.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie, with a frequent tendency to play scissors, remains valid and effective.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie, and considering their frequent use of scissors, they lost the last round when they played scissors. Therefore, they are likely to switch their move. Given their pattern, they might switch to rock or paper. However, since they frequently play scissors, they might switch to rock to counter my frequent rock plays.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's potential switch to rock, my best move would be to play paper, as it beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {232: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.68787, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 268: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent often plays rock after a loss or tie, as seen in rounds 276, 273, 268, and 232.
   - They tend to repeat their move after a win, as observed in rounds where they won with paper or scissors and repeated the same move.
   - There is a noticeable frequency of the opponent playing scissors, which suggests a potential bias towards this move.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie.
   - They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.
   - The hypotheses have consistently predicted the opponent's next play as rock, suggesting a pattern of switching to rock after a loss or tie.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards are often achieved when playing paper against the predicted rock, confirming the hypothesis.
   - Playing rock against scissors also yields positive rewards, supporting the idea that the opponent frequently plays scissors.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a mix of repeating their move after a win and switching to rock after a loss or tie.
   - The frequent play of scissors can be exploited by playing rock more often.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations. The opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating their move after a win and switching after a loss or tie, and given that they lost the last round (they played rock and I played paper), they are likely to switch their move. Since they frequently play scissors, it is likely they will switch to scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {268: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.6607742691, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 273: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.1572567452854935, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win. For instance, in rounds 237 and 238, the opponent played 'rock' after winning with 'rock'.
   - The opponent switches their move after a loss. For example, in rounds 235 and 236, the opponent switched from 'rock' to 'rock' after losing with 'rock'.
   - The opponent switches their move after a tie. For example, in rounds 229 and 230, the opponent switched from 'rock' to 'scissors' after a tie with 'rock'.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The most consistent hypothesis is that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. This hypothesis has been supported by multiple rounds and has a relatively high value of confidence.

3. **Static Strategy Consideration**:
   - There is no clear indication that the opponent is playing a static strategy, as they seem to change their moves based on the outcome of the previous round.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing 'rock' has resulted in mixed rewards, with both wins and losses. However, playing 'scissors' against the predicted 'paper' has often resulted in a win.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely following a strategy where they repeat their move after a win and switch their move after a loss or tie. This strategy aligns with the observed data and previous hypotheses.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the previous observations:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after they win, they repeat their move. In the last round, the opponent played 'paper' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.76254198837, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. In the last round, they played 'paper' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch from 'paper' to 'rock' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my best counter move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {268: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.23377939185899999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 273: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.21680370000000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

Top hypotheses: {268: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.23377939185899999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 273: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent's strategy was hypothesized to be: 
     - After a win, they repeat their move.
     - After a loss, they switch their move.
     - After a tie, they switch their move.

2. **Recent Interaction Analysis**:
   - **Round 278**: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won. 
     - According to the hypothesis, the opponent should repeat paper.
   - **Round 279**: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost.
     - According to the hypothesis, the opponent should switch from scissors.

3. **Testing the Hypothesis**:
   - The hypothesis predicts the opponent's next move based on their last outcome (win, loss, tie).
   - The opponent's play in round 279 (scissors) after losing in round 278 (paper) aligns with the hypothesis that they switch after a loss.

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to follow the hypothesized strategy consistently, as their moves align with the predicted pattern.
   - The hypothesis has been consistent in predicting the opponent's behavior, indicating it is a reliable model of their strategy.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play rock, I often receive positive rewards, indicating the opponent frequently plays scissors or paper.
   - When I play paper, I sometimes receive negative rewards, suggesting the opponent occasionally plays scissors.

**Conclusion**:
The opponent likely follows a strategy where they repeat their move after a win, switch after a loss, and switch after a tie. This strategy has been consistent with the observed interaction history.

}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing, they switch their move. In the last round, they played 'scissors' and won, so they will likely repeat 'scissors' in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'scissors', I should play 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: The most consistent hypothesis is that the opponent switches their move after a loss or tie and repeats their move after a win. This hypothesis has been repeated multiple times with varying confidence levels.

2. **Interaction History**: 
   - From rounds 231 to 280, there are several instances where the opponent's play aligns with the hypothesis:
     - After losing (e.g., round 235: opponent played rock and lost to scissors), they switched from rock to paper (round 236).
     - After tying (e.g., round 231: both played paper), they switched from paper to rock (round 232).
     - After winning (e.g., round 238: opponent played paper and won against rock), they repeated paper (round 239).

3. **Pattern Recognition**: The opponent seems to frequently play scissors, which has been exploited by playing rock. This aligns with the hypothesis that they switch moves after a loss or tie, often leading them back to scissors.

4. **Reward Analysis**: Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors. This suggests that the opponent's strategy can be countered effectively by playing rock.

5. **Conclusion**: The hypothesis that the opponent switches their move after a loss or tie and repeats their move after a win explains the data well. The frequent occurrence of scissors in their play can be exploited by consistently playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round where they played scissors and I played rock, they are likely to switch their move. Given their tendency to frequently play scissors, they might switch to rock or paper. However, considering their pattern, they might switch to paper to counter my rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {275: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python

            You last played: scissors

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {275: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 268: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.02455190201091001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 273: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.01623381300000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to frequently play scissors, as noted in the hypothesis from round 275.
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their move.
   - After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - From rounds 232 to 281, the opponent's plays after a win often repeat the winning move.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move, which aligns with the hypothesis from rounds 268 and 273.
   - After a tie, the opponent also switches their move, as seen in the recent rounds.

3. **Hypothesis Evaluation**:
   - The hypothesis from round 275 seems to be the most consistent with the observed data. The opponent frequently plays scissors and switches their move after a loss or tie, while repeating after a win.

4. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be summarized as: "After a win, repeat the move. After a loss or tie, switch the move. Frequently play scissors."

5. **Exploitation Strategy**:
   - Given the frequent play of scissors, playing rock can be advantageous.
   - After observing a win by the opponent, anticipate a repeat of the move.
   - After a loss or tie, expect a switch, and prepare to counter the likely next move.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of switching their move after a tie, and the fact that the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, I predict that the opponent will switch from scissors to rock in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {278: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: 
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their move. For example, in rounds 236 and 237, the opponent played 'rock' after winning with 'rock' in round 235.
   - After a loss, the opponent switches their move. For instance, in round 238, after losing with 'rock' in round 237, the opponent switched to 'paper'.
   - After a tie, the opponent switches their move. For example, in round 233, after a tie with 'scissors', the opponent switched to 'paper' in round 234.

2. **Consistency Check**:
   - The hypothesis from round 278 seems to hold true for the subsequent rounds, as the opponent's behavior aligns with the pattern of repeating moves after a win, switching after a loss, and switching after a tie.

3. **Static Strategy Consideration**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be dynamic rather than static, as they adjust their moves based on the outcome of the previous round.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When playing 'rock', I have received positive rewards consistently when the opponent played 'scissors' (e.g., rounds 239, 241, 244, 247, 251, 260, 262, 264, 275, 280).
   - This suggests that the opponent's strategy can be exploited by predicting their next move based on the outcome of the previous round.

Given this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after a tie, and the last round being a tie with both playing paper, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted scissors play by the opponent, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {280: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 258: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.2325601411801329, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {280: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 258: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.2325601411801329, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Wins**: When the opponent wins, they seem to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 235: Opponent wins with rock against scissors, next play is rock (no switch).
   - Round 238: Opponent wins with paper against rock, next play is paper (no switch).
   - Round 257: Opponent wins with paper against rock, next play is paper (no switch).

2. **Losses**: When the opponent loses, they seem to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 237: Opponent loses with rock against paper, next play is paper (switch).
   - Round 239: Opponent loses with paper against scissors, next play is scissors (switch).
   - Round 241: Opponent loses with scissors against rock, next play is rock (switch).

3. **Ties**: When the opponent ties, they seem to switch their move. For example:
   - Round 234: Tie with paper, next play is rock (switch).
   - Round 252: Tie with rock, next play is scissors (switch).
   - Round 270: Tie with rock, next play is scissors (switch).

From this analysis, it seems that the opponent's strategy is consistent with the hypothesis: after a win, they repeat their move; after a loss or a tie, they switch their move. This strategy aligns with the previous hypotheses and explains the observed data well.

Regarding rewards, when I play rock, I have received mixed results, but generally, I have been able to win when the opponent plays scissors. Playing paper seems to be a more consistent counter to their strategy, especially if they tend to switch to rock after a tie or loss.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to use the hypothesis that the opponent switches their move after a tie or loss and repeats their move after a win.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after a tie, and the last round resulted in a tie with both playing rock, I predict that the opponent will switch from rock to paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {275: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 278: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {275: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 278: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie.
   - They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - The opponent has played scissors in rounds 281, 283, and 284, resulting in ties.
   - Before these ties, they played paper in round 282, which was also a tie.
   - They played rock in round 283, which was a tie.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their move.
   - After a loss or tie, they switch their move.
   - The opponent has a tendency to play scissors frequently, as observed in the recent rounds.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play rock, I often receive positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - Playing scissors against their scissors results in a tie, yielding no reward.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern where they repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie.
   - They have a tendency to play scissors frequently, which can be exploited by playing rock.

Given this analysis, the previous hypothesis still holds true. The opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent tends to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie. Since the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to switch from scissors. Given their frequent play of scissors, they might switch to rock or paper. However, considering their tendency to play scissors often, they might switch to rock to counter my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely switch to rock, my best play would be paper, as it beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {280: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 258: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {280: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.20612999999999998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 258: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.20395446917826515, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**: Both hypotheses suggest that the opponent switches their move after a tie and a loss, and repeats their move after a win. The predicted opponent's next play was 'paper', and my next play was 'scissors' to counter it.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - **Round 282**: Tie with both playing 'paper'.
   - **Round 283**: Tie with both playing 'rock'.
   - **Round 284**: Tie with both playing 'scissors'.
   - **Round 285**: Tie with both playing 'paper'.

   In the last four rounds, the opponent has consistently played the same move as me, resulting in ties. This suggests that the opponent might be mirroring my moves or sticking to a pattern that results in ties.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's behavior in recent rounds does not align with the previous hypothesis of switching moves after a tie. Instead, they seem to be repeating the same move as me, leading to ties.
   - This could indicate a strategy where the opponent mirrors my moves or follows a fixed pattern that coincidentally matches my plays.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors', the outcomes have been mixed, with no clear pattern of consistently positive or negative rewards.
   - The ties suggest that the opponent's strategy might be to neutralize my plays rather than actively counter them.

5. **Refined Hypothesis**:
   - Given the recent rounds, the opponent might be playing a strategy that involves mirroring my moves or sticking to a pattern that results in ties. This deviates from the previous hypothesis of switching moves after a tie.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to involve mirroring my moves or following a pattern that results in ties. This is a deviation from the previous hypothesis, which suggested switching moves after a tie.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent mirrors my moves or follows a pattern that results in ties, deviating from the previous hypothesis of switching moves after a tie.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of mirroring my moves or following a pattern that results in ties, and considering the last action I played was paper, it is likely that their next play will be paper again to maintain the pattern of ties.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Patterns in Opponent's Plays**:
   - The opponent has played each of the three moves (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - There is no clear pattern of repeating the same move consecutively for many rounds.
   - The opponent's plays seem to be somewhat balanced among rock, paper, and scissors.

2. **Outcome Analysis**:
   - When I played rock, the outcomes were mixed: wins against scissors, losses against paper, and ties against rock.
   - When I played paper, I won against rock, lost against scissors, and tied against paper.
   - When I played scissors, I won against paper, lost against rock, and tied against scissors.

3. **Hypothesis Formation**:
   - The opponent does not seem to be adapting based on my previous plays, as there is no consistent pattern of countering my last move.
   - The opponent's strategy might be a random or balanced distribution of rock, paper, and scissors, without a clear bias towards any particular move.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I correctly predict the opponent's move, but there is no consistent move that guarantees a win.
   - The distribution of rewards suggests that the opponent is not using a static strategy that can be easily exploited.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Given the lack of a discernible pattern or bias in the opponent's plays, it is likely that the opponent is using a random or balanced strategy.
   - This means that the opponent's moves are not easily predictable, and a counter-strategy would involve maintaining a balanced play of rock, paper, and scissors to maximize the chances of winning.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent appears to be using a random or balanced strategy, with no clear pattern or bias towards any particular move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy appears to be random or balanced with no clear pattern, it is difficult to predict their exact next move. However, considering the last move was 'rock', they might choose 'paper' to cover their previous play.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the possibility of the opponent playing 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {258: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.18993768989734994, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 234: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.18993768989734994, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 234: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - **Hypothesis 1**: After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.
   - **Hypothesis 2**: The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.

2. **Recent Interaction Analysis**:
   - **Round 286**: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost (-1).
   - **Round 287**: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost (-1).

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent played rock in both rounds 286 and 287, resulting in my loss both times.
   - The opponent seems to have repeated their move after winning in round 286, which aligns with the first hypothesis.

4. **Further Analysis**:
   - Looking at the broader history, the opponent's behavior seems to fit the pattern of repeating their move after a win. This is consistent with the first hypothesis.
   - There is no clear evidence of frequent scissors play in the recent rounds, which weakens the second hypothesis.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent likely follows a strategy where they repeat their move after a win. This is supported by their repeated rock play after winning in round 286.
   - The first hypothesis seems to explain the opponent's behavior well.

Based on this analysis, I will refine the hypothesis to focus on the opponent repeating their move after a win.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {258: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.432956382928145, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 234: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Observation of Patterns:**
   - The opponent tends to play "rock" frequently after a loss or tie, as seen in rounds 254, 255, 266, 267, 272, 277, and 287.
   - After winning, the opponent seems to repeat their move, as observed in rounds 240, 250, 259, 269, 274, and 279.
   - The opponent switches their move after a tie, as seen in rounds 252, 253, 261, 270, 271, 281, 282, 283, 284, and 285.

2. **Evaluation of Hypotheses:**
   - The hypothesis from round 258 suggests that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This aligns with the observed data.
   - The hypothesis from round 288 also aligns well, indicating that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.

3. **Static Strategy Consideration:**
   - The opponent's frequent play of "rock" after a loss or tie suggests a tendency towards a static strategy that can be exploited by playing "paper."

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing "paper" has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when predicting the opponent's "rock" play.

Based on the analysis, the most consistent hypothesis is that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. This strategy can be exploited by anticipating their next move based on the outcome of the previous round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. In the last round, they played 'rock' and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch to 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper', my next play should be 'scissors' to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {258: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.6030694680497015, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 288: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {258: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss, the opponent switches their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.6030694680497015, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 288: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 289: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent repeats their move after a win.
   - The opponent switches their move after a loss or tie.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - Round 288: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock', I won.
   - Round 289: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper', I won.

3. **Analysis**:
   - In round 288, the opponent played 'rock' and lost. According to the hypothesis, they should switch their move. They switched to 'paper' in round 289, which aligns with the hypothesis.
   - In round 289, the opponent played 'paper' and lost. If the hypothesis holds, they should switch their move again.

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to switch their move after a loss, which is consistent with the hypothesis.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent switches their move after a loss or tie and repeats after a win seems to be holding true.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have been getting positive rewards when playing 'scissors' against 'paper' and 'rock' against 'scissors', indicating that the opponent's strategy can be exploited by predicting their next move based on the hypothesis.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be: After a win, they repeat their move. After a loss or tie, they switch their move.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to use the hypothesis to predict the opponent's next move and choose my counter move accordingly.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after losing the last round (since they played paper and I played scissors), they are likely to switch their move. Since they played paper last, they might switch to rock next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 234: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.13410000000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 258: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the recent interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Recent Interaction History:**
   - The opponent has shown a tendency to play scissors frequently, especially after a win or a tie.
   - After a loss, they tend to switch their move.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - Hypothesis 1: After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.
   - Hypothesis 2: The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors.
   - Hypothesis 3: After a win for me, the opponent switches their move. After a loss for me, the opponent repeats their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.

3. **Analysis:**
   - The opponent's frequent use of scissors suggests a pattern that can be exploited by playing rock.
   - The opponent seems to repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie, aligning with Hypothesis 1 and 2.
   - The opponent's behavior after a tie or loss is consistent with switching moves, which supports Hypothesis 1.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be: after a win, they repeat their move; after a loss or tie, they switch their move. They have a tendency to play scissors frequently.

Based on this analysis, the best counter-strategy is to play rock more often, as it counters their frequent use of scissors and aligns with their tendency to repeat moves after a win.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, they tend to repeat their move after a win. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, it is likely that they will play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.8319300000000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. Since they lost the last round (opponent played rock and I played paper), they are likely to switch their move. The pattern suggests they might switch from rock to paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {234: {'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.', 'value': 0.32887941, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 255: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win for me, the opponent switches their move.

After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.2829963, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 288: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.282351, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 291: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To understand the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent frequently plays scissors, which has been noted in several hypotheses.
   - After a win, the opponent tends to repeat their move.
   - After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.

2. **Recent Rounds Analysis**:
   - In round 292, I played paper and the opponent played rock, resulting in a win for me. In round 293, the opponent switched to scissors, which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch after a loss.
   - In round 293, both played scissors resulting in a tie. The hypothesis suggests the opponent will switch after a tie.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors frequently.
   - The opponent's tendency to play scissors can be exploited by playing rock.

4. **Hypothesis Validation**:
   - The hypothesis that the opponent repeats their move after a win and switches after a loss or tie seems consistent with the recent rounds.
   - The frequent play of scissors by the opponent is a notable pattern that can be exploited.

Based on the above analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move. They frequently play scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock.'
}
```

This hypothesis suggests that playing rock is a strong counter-strategy, given the opponent's frequent use of scissors and their tendency to switch moves after a loss or tie.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a tie, they tend to switch their move. Since the last round ended in a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent is likely to switch from scissors. Given their frequent play of scissors, they might switch to rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                The total interaction history is: [{'round': 245, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 246, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 247, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 248, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 249, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 250, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 251, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 252, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 253, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 254, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 255, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 256, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 257, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 258, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 259, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 260, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 261, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 262, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 263, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 264, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 265, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 266, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 267, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 268, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 269, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 270, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 271, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 272, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 273, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 274, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 275, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 276, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 277, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 278, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 279, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 280, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 281, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 282, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 283, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 284, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 285, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 286, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 287, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 288, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 289, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 290, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 291, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 292, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 293, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 294, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}].
                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {288: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.49764569999999997, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {288: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.49764569999999997, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent repeats their move after a win and switches their move after a loss or tie. This hypothesis had a value of 0.49764569999999997, suggesting it was somewhat consistent with observed behavior.

2. **Recent Rounds Analysis**:
   - **Round 288**: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won. Next round, opponent played paper.
   - **Round 289**: I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won. Next round, opponent played scissors.
   - **Round 290**: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost. Next round, opponent played rock.
   - **Round 291**: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won. Next round, opponent played rock.
   - **Round 292**: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won. Next round, opponent played scissors.
   - **Round 293**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors, tie. Next round, opponent played paper.
   - **Round 294**: I played paper, opponent played paper, tie.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - After a win, the opponent seems to switch their move.
   - After a loss, the opponent seems to switch their move.
   - After a tie, the opponent seems to switch their move.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent switches their move regardless of the outcome (win, loss, or tie). This is a slight modification from the previous hypothesis, which suggested repeating after a win.

5. **Static Strategy Check**:
   - There is no consistent pattern of the opponent playing the same move repeatedly that results in a positive or negative reward for me. The opponent seems to be switching moves consistently.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy appears to be switching their move after every round, regardless of the outcome.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches their move after every round, regardless of win, loss, or tie.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after every round, and considering their last play was 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'scissors'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {255: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win for me, the opponent switches their move. After a loss for me, the opponent repeats their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.22866818699999997, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 289: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - **Hypothesis 1 (Round 255)**: After a win for me, the opponent switches their move. After a loss for me, the opponent repeats their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.
   - **Hypothesis 2 (Round 289)**: After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.
   - **Hypothesis 3 (Round 288)**: After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.

2. **Recent Interaction Analysis**:
   - **Round 294**: Tie (Paper vs. Paper) -> Opponent played Rock in Round 295.
   - **Round 293**: Tie (Scissors vs. Scissors) -> Opponent played Paper in Round 294.
   - **Round 292**: Loss for opponent (Rock vs. Paper) -> Opponent played Scissors in Round 293.
   - **Round 291**: Win for opponent (Scissors vs. Rock) -> Opponent played Rock in Round 292.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - After a win (Round 291), the opponent switched from Scissors to Rock.
   - After a loss (Round 292), the opponent switched from Rock to Scissors.
   - After a tie (Round 293), the opponent switched from Scissors to Paper.
   - After a tie (Round 294), the opponent switched from Paper to Rock.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to switch their move after a win, loss, or tie. This aligns with Hypothesis 2 and 3, where the opponent switches after a loss or tie. However, the switching after a win contradicts the repetition in Hypothesis 2 and 3.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be switching their move after every round, regardless of the outcome. This is a simple strategy that doesn't depend on the outcome of the previous round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches their move after every round, regardless of the outcome.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of switching their move after every round, and considering their last play was 'rock', I predict their next play will be 'paper'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {255: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win for me, the opponent switches their move. After a loss for me, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays after my wins, losses, and ties show a pattern where they often switch their move.
   - For instance, after I win with scissors against their paper, they switch to rock, which beats scissors.
   - After a tie, they also tend to switch their move.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The most recent hypothesis suggests that the opponent switches their move after every round, regardless of the outcome.
   - This hypothesis aligns with the observed pattern where the opponent frequently changes their move after each round.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have been getting positive rewards when playing scissors against their predicted paper, which supports the hypothesis that they switch moves.
   - This indicates that the opponent's strategy is predictable and can be exploited by anticipating their next move.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - Given the consistent pattern of switching moves, the hypothesis that the opponent switches their move after every round seems to be the most accurate.
   - This strategy can be exploited by predicting their next move based on the switch pattern and selecting the counter move.

In conclusion, the opponent's strategy appears to be a simple move-switching pattern after each round. This can be effectively countered by predicting their next move and choosing the appropriate counter move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'The opponent switches their move after every round, regardless of the outcome.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of switching their move after every round, and considering their last play was 'paper', I predict their next play will be 'rock'.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {255: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win for me, the opponent switches their move. After a loss for me, the opponent repeats their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.', 'value': 0.022047411629999958, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 289: {'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - **Hypothesis 1 (Round 255):** After a win for me, the opponent switches their move. After a loss for me, the opponent repeats their move. After a tie, the opponent switches their move.
   - **Hypothesis 2 (Round 289):** After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.

2. **Recent Interaction Analysis:**
   - **Round 296:** I played scissors, opponent played paper, I won. 
     - **Round 297:** I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost.
     - This sequence supports Hypothesis 2, as the opponent switched their move after losing in Round 296.

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - When I win, the opponent tends to switch their move.
   - When I lose, the opponent tends to repeat their move.
   - When there's a tie, the opponent switches their move.

4. **Static Strategy Check:**
   - I have received positive rewards when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock, indicating the opponent might not be playing a static strategy but rather a reactive one.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to align more with Hypothesis 2, where they repeat their move after a win and switch after a loss or tie.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy is likely reactive, switching moves after a loss or tie and repeating after a win. This understanding can be used to predict their next move and choose the optimal counter-strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a win, they repeat their move. In the last round, they played scissors and won. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win the opponent plays the move that would lose to their last rounds move. 
                                    After a loss the opponent plays the same move as they did in the last round. 
                                    After a tie the opponent plays the move that would beat their last rounds move'
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To determine the opponent's likely strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's moves after a win, loss, or tie seem to follow a pattern where they often switch their move after a loss or tie and repeat their move after a win.
   - For example, in round 250, the opponent played 'scissors' after losing with 'paper' in round 249. In round 251, after losing with 'scissors', they switched to 'rock' in round 252.
   - This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that after a win, the opponent repeats their move, and after a loss or tie, they switch their move.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The most consistent hypothesis is: "After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move."
   - This hypothesis has been suggested multiple times with a relatively high value, indicating it fits the observed data well.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When playing 'rock', I have consistently received positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays 'scissors', which aligns with the hypothesis that they switch to 'scissors' after a loss or tie.

Given this analysis, the most likely strategy for the opponent is that they repeat their move after a win and switch their move after a loss or tie. This strategy aligns with the observed data and previous hypotheses.

Based on this hypothesis, I should continue playing 'rock' as it has been effective against the opponent's likely next move, 'scissors'.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'After a win, the opponent repeats their move. After a loss or tie, the opponent switches their move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy, after a loss, they switch their move. In the last round, they played scissors and lost. Therefore, they are likely to switch to rock in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```
