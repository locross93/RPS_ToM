                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history. 
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between. 
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm. 
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice? 
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock. 
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy. 
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the interaction history, we see that in round 1, I played 'scissors' and my opponent played 'rock', resulting in a loss for me (-1 reward). 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Plays**: 
   - I played 'scissors', which loses to 'rock'.
   - The opponent played 'rock', which indicates they may have a preference for this choice.

2. **Reward Analysis**: 
   - I received a negative reward (-1) for this round, indicating that my choice was not effective against the opponent's choice.
   - If the opponent consistently plays 'rock', I would continue to lose if I keep playing 'scissors'.

3. **Hypothesis Formation**: 
   - Given that I lost to 'rock', it is possible that my opponent is either playing a static strategy (always playing 'rock') or a strategy that favors 'rock' over other choices.
   - Since I have no additional rounds to analyze yet, I cannot confirm if they are adapting or if they have a more complex strategy.

4. **Exploitability**: 
   - If the opponent is indeed playing 'rock' consistently, I can exploit this by switching to 'paper', which beats 'rock' and would yield a positive reward in the next round.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy, possibly favoring 'rock'.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play rock again, I believe my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's likely policy based on the interaction history, let's break down the information we have:

1. **Round 0**: I played scissors, and my opponent played rock. I lost and received -1 reward.
2. **Round 1**: I played paper, and my opponent played scissors. I lost again and received -1 reward.

From these two rounds, we can observe the following:

- In both rounds, I lost to my opponent's choices. This suggests that my opponent is not randomly selecting their plays but rather has a consistent strategy that is currently beating my choices.
- In Round 0, my scissors lost to their rock, which means they played rock.
- In Round 1, my paper lost to their scissors, indicating they played scissors.

Given that my opponent has played rock and scissors in the first two rounds, it is possible that they are alternating between these two choices or have a preference for one of them. However, since they have not played paper yet, it could indicate that they are avoiding it, possibly because they believe it is a weaker choice against my strategy.

### Hypothesis:
- The opponent may be using a static strategy that favors either rock or scissors. Since they have won both rounds, they might be alternating between these two choices or consistently favoring one of them. The absence of paper in their plays suggests they might be avoiding it, which could mean they are aware of its weakness against scissors.

### Summary of Hypothesis:
```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is alternating between rock and scissors, avoiding paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent has played scissors in the last round and has previously played rock, it seems they are alternating between these two plays. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock, as they might switch back from scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted play of rock, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```
