User Message: Total Rewards:- player_0: 0

            
                An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 0, {'round': 0, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}.
                The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}].
                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.
                
            


            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 1, {'round': 0, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}].
            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': ''}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Given that the opponent played "paper" and I also played "paper" resulting in a tie, I can't draw any conclusions about their likely policy yet. Since the reward was 0, it doesn't provide any information about their strategy. I will need more rounds of data to form a hypothesis about their likely policy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': ''
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent played paper in the last round and assuming they have no specific strategy, their next play is unpredictable. However, since they just played paper, they might be inclined to switch to rock or scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering the unpredictability of the opponent's play, it would be best to play rock in the next round as it has an equal chance of winning against both paper and scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```
