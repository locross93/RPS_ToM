User Message: Total Rewards:- player_0: -1

            
                An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 0, {'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}.
                The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}].
                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', and my opponent played 'paper'. I received a reward of -1, indicating a loss.

Given that we only have one round of data, it's challenging to determine a definitive strategy for my opponent. However, we can make some initial observations:

- **Static Strategy Possibility**: The opponent played 'paper'. If they are using a static strategy, they might continue to play 'paper' in subsequent rounds. This would mean they are not adapting to my plays but sticking to one choice.

- **Adaptive Strategy Possibility**: With only one round, it's hard to determine if the opponent is adapting to my strategy. If they are, they might have predicted my play of 'rock' and countered it with 'paper'.

- **Random Strategy Possibility**: The opponent could also be playing randomly, and 'paper' was just their choice for this round.

Since I received a negative reward for playing 'rock', it suggests that playing 'rock' against this opponent's current strategy (or random choice) is not beneficial. If the opponent continues to play 'paper', I should switch to 'scissors' to counter it.

Given the limited data, my initial hypothesis is that the opponent might be using a static strategy of playing 'paper'. However, I will need more rounds to confirm this hypothesis.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Possible static strategy of playing paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent played paper in the first round and my guess is that they might be using a static strategy of playing paper, I believe their next play will likely be paper again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play paper again, my best counter move would be scissors to beat their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```
