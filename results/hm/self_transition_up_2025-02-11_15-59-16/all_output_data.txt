                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.

                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the first interaction, my opponent played "scissors" and I played "paper", resulting in a negative reward for me. This suggests that my opponent's likely policy is to play the winning move against my previous play. Since I received a negative reward for playing "paper", it's likely that my opponent will continue to play "scissors" in an attempt to exploit my strategy.

Hypothesis:
My opponent's strategy is to play the winning move against my previous play.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'counter_previous_play'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of "counter_previous_play" and their last play being scissors, it is likely that they will continue to counter your previous play and choose rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, you should play paper in the next round.

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent's strategy is to counter my previous play. In the first round, I played paper and they played rock, resulting in a positive reward for me. This suggests that they may be playing a static strategy and I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

Hypothesis:
The opponent's strategy is to counter my previous play with a static strategy.

```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of "counter_previous_play" and their last play of rock, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, your next play should be rock to counter their play.

Response:

My opponent played paper when I played rock, resulting in a negative reward for me. Based on this, it seems like my opponent is not playing a static strategy and may be adapting to my choices. Since my opponent played scissors when I played paper in the first round, it indicates that they are not consistently playing the same choice. Therefore, it is difficult to determine a specific strategy at this point.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Adaptive'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's previous plays and the fact that their strategy is adaptive, it is likely that they will continue to exploit your last play by choosing scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, you should choose rock in the next round.

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent is not consistently playing the same choice. However, they have played scissors twice and rock once, while I have played paper, paper, and rock. This suggests that the opponent may not be following a static strategy, but rather reacting to my previous plays. 

Given that the opponent has played scissors twice, it's possible that they are employing a strategy to counter my previous play. This is further supported by the fact that I received a negative reward when playing paper and a positive reward when playing rock. 

Therefore, I hypothesize that the opponent's strategy may involve countering my previous play. They may be adapting to my choices to gain an advantage. 

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'counter_previous_play'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is 'counter_previous_play' and they played scissors in the last round, they are likely to play rock in the next round to counter your previous play of rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock in the next round, your next play should be paper to counter their expected move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
