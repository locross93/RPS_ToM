Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0 Analysis**:
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - Result: Tie (0 reward)

Since this is the first round, we have limited information. The opponent played "scissors" in this round. There are several possibilities for their strategy:

- **Static Strategy**: The opponent might be playing a static strategy where they always choose "scissors." If this is the case, I can exploit this by consistently playing "rock" in future rounds to win.

- **Random Strategy**: The opponent might be playing randomly, and "scissors" was just a coincidental choice. If this is the case, predicting their next move becomes challenging without more data.

- **Pattern-Based Strategy**: The opponent might be following a pattern or sequence that includes "scissors" as the first move. Without more rounds, it's difficult to identify any pattern.

Given the current data, it's too early to definitively conclude the opponent's strategy. However, the hypothesis that the opponent might be using a static "scissors" strategy is worth considering, as it can be easily tested in the next few rounds.

In summary, my initial hypothesis is that the opponent could be playing a static "scissors" strategy. I will need more rounds to confirm or refute this hypothesis.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Possible static scissors strategy'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent played scissors in the first round and I suspect a possible static scissors strategy, I believe their next play will be scissors again.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play scissors again, my best counter move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {1: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Possible static scissors strategy', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine my opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and my previous hypotheses:

1. **Round 0**: 
   - My play: Scissors
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - My reward: 0 (Tie)

2. **Round 1**:
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - My reward: 3 (Win)

**Previous Hypothesis**: 
- The opponent might be using a "static scissors strategy," meaning they consistently play scissors. This hypothesis was based on the first two rounds where the opponent played scissors both times.

**Analysis**:
- In both rounds, the opponent played scissors. 
- When I played rock in round 1, I received a positive reward, indicating a win against scissors.
- The hypothesis that the opponent is using a static scissors strategy is consistent with the data observed so far.

**Conclusion**:
- Given the consistent play of scissors by the opponent in the first two rounds, the hypothesis that they are using a static scissors strategy remains strong.
- I am getting positive rewards when playing rock, which counters scissors effectively.

**Strategy**:
- Continue playing rock to exploit the opponent's static scissors strategy, as it has yielded positive rewards.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Static scissors strategy'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent has consistently played scissors in the previous rounds, I believe their next play will continue to be scissors, as they seem to be following a static scissors strategy.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play scissors again, I should play rock to counter their strategy and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: Both players played 'scissors', resulting in a tie. This doesn't provide much information about the opponent's strategy as it was the first round.

2. **Round 1**: I played 'rock' and the opponent played 'scissors'. I won this round, which suggests that the opponent might not be consistently playing 'scissors', as they would likely change their strategy after losing.

3. **Round 2**: Both players played 'rock', resulting in another tie. This indicates that the opponent might be switching their plays or could be randomizing their choices.

Given the limited data, it's challenging to pinpoint a specific strategy. However, the opponent has played 'scissors' and 'rock' so far. There is no clear pattern yet, but they might be using a random strategy or a simple pattern that hasn't emerged clearly.

Since I received a positive reward when playing 'rock' in round 1, it might be beneficial to continue playing 'rock' until more data is available to refine the hypothesis.

Hypothesis: The opponent might be using a random strategy or a simple pattern that hasn't been fully revealed yet.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern not yet clear'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the previous plays, the opponent has played 'scissors', 'scissors', and 'rock'. Since their strategy is not clear and might be random, it's possible they might switch to 'paper' to counter my 'rock' play.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the potential 'paper' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'scissors'.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: Both players played scissors, resulting in a tie. This doesn't give much information about the opponent's strategy.

2. **Round 1**: I played rock, and the opponent played scissors. I won this round, which suggests that the opponent might not be consistently playing rock.

3. **Round 2**: Both players played rock, resulting in a tie. This indicates that the opponent might be switching strategies or playing randomly.

4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, and the opponent played rock. I lost this round, which suggests the opponent might be playing rock more frequently.

From this limited data, it's difficult to determine a clear pattern. However, the opponent has played rock twice in four rounds, which could suggest a slight preference for rock. 

- **Hypothesis**: The opponent might have a tendency to play rock more often than other choices, but the sample size is too small to be certain. They could also be playing randomly or following a pattern that hasn't emerged yet.

- **Strategy Implication**: If the opponent tends to play rock, I should consider playing paper more often to counter this potential tendency.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Slight tendency to play rock, but could be random or pattern not yet clear'

```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the interaction history, the opponent has shown a tendency to play rock twice in the last four rounds. Given this pattern and their last play being rock, it is likely that they might continue with rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: Both played scissors, resulting in a tie. This doesn't give us much information about the opponent's strategy.

2. **Round 1**: I played rock, and the opponent played scissors. I won this round. This suggests that the opponent might not be consistently playing scissors, as they might have switched strategies after this loss.

3. **Round 2**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie. This could indicate the opponent is trying to counter my previous play of rock, or it could be a random choice.

4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, and the opponent played rock. I lost this round. The opponent might be trying to counter my previous play of rock with rock, expecting me to play rock again.

5. **Round 4**: I played paper, and the opponent played scissors. I lost this round. The opponent might be trying to counter my previous play of scissors with scissors, expecting me to play scissors again.

From this analysis, it seems the opponent might be trying to counter my previous play, but it's not consistent enough to confirm. They could also be playing a random strategy or a pattern that hasn't fully emerged yet.

Given the limited data, a hypothesis could be that the opponent is playing a strategy that involves countering my previous play, but with some randomness or inconsistency.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Counter previous play with some randomness'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy seems to involve countering my previous play with some randomness, and considering my last play was 'paper', the opponent might play 'rock' to counter my 'paper'. However, since there is some randomness, they might also choose 'scissors' again as they did in the last round. 

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the possibility of the opponent playing 'rock', I should play 'paper'. However, to also cover the possibility of them playing 'scissors' again, I should consider playing 'rock'. Given the randomness, 'rock' seems like a safer choice as it would result in a win against 'scissors' and a tie against 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Both played scissors, resulting in a tie.
2. **Round 1**: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won.
3. **Round 2**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost.
5. **Round 4**: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost.
6. **Round 5**: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost.

Let's look for patterns:

- The opponent has played scissors twice (rounds 0 and 1), rock twice (rounds 2 and 3), and paper twice (rounds 4 and 5).
- The opponent's choices seem to cycle through scissors, rock, and paper in order. 

**Hypothesis**:
The opponent might be following a cyclic strategy: scissors → rock → paper. This pattern repeats every three rounds.

**Strategy Implication**:
If the opponent continues this cycle, their next move should be scissors. To counter this, I should play rock in the next round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_srp'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent's strategy is cyclic_srp (scissors, rock, paper), and their last play was paper, I believe their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play scissors next, I should play rock to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: Both players played scissors, resulting in a tie. This doesn't give us much information about the opponent's strategy.
2. **Round 1**: I played rock, and the opponent played scissors. I won this round, suggesting that the opponent might not be consistently countering my moves.
3. **Round 2**: Both players played rock, resulting in a tie. This could suggest that the opponent might be repeating moves or playing randomly.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, and the opponent played rock. I lost this round, indicating that the opponent might have switched to rock.
5. **Round 4**: I played paper, and the opponent played scissors. I lost again, suggesting the opponent might be favoring scissors.
6. **Round 5**: I played rock, and the opponent played paper. I lost, indicating the opponent might be switching strategies or playing randomly.
7. **Round 6**: Both players played rock, resulting in a tie. This again suggests a possible repetition or random play.

From the above analysis, the opponent's strategy doesn't seem to follow a clear pattern. However, there are a few observations:
- The opponent has played rock twice, scissors twice, and paper once in the last five rounds.
- The opponent's plays don't seem to be directly countering my previous plays consistently.
- There might be a slight tendency towards playing rock and scissors more frequently.

Given the lack of a clear pattern, the opponent might be playing a somewhat random strategy or a strategy with a slight bias towards rock and scissors.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Random with slight bias towards rock and scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of being random with a slight bias towards rock and scissors, and considering the recent plays, it seems they might continue with rock or switch to scissors. However, given the recent tie with rock, they might try to switch to scissors to counter my rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the possibility of the opponent playing scissors, my best move would be to play rock, which beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: Both played 'scissors', resulting in a tie.
2. **Round 1**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors'. I won.
3. **Round 2**: Both played 'rock', resulting in a tie.
4. **Round 3**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock'. I lost.
5. **Round 4**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors'. I lost.
6. **Round 5**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost.
7. **Round 6**: Both played 'rock', resulting in a tie.
8. **Round 7**: Both played 'rock', resulting in a tie.

**Observations:**
- The opponent has played 'rock' in rounds 2, 3, 6, and 7.
- The opponent has played 'scissors' in rounds 0, 1, and 4.
- The opponent has played 'paper' in round 5.

**Hypothesis:**
- The opponent seems to have a preference for 'rock', as it has been played in four out of eight rounds.
- The opponent's choice does not appear to be purely random, as 'rock' is played more frequently.
- There is no clear pattern of cycling through 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors', but 'rock' is the most frequent choice.

**Strategy:**
- Given the frequent use of 'rock', I should consider playing 'paper' more often to counter this tendency.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Preference for rock, with occasional scissors and paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's preference for rock, with occasional scissors and paper, and the fact that they have played rock for the last three rounds, it is likely they may continue with rock. However, there is a possibility they might switch to scissors or paper to break the pattern. Considering their strategy, the most probable next play is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be paper, as it beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Preference for rock, with occasional scissors and paper.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To understand the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Both played scissors, resulting in a tie.
2. **Round 1**: I played rock, opponent played scissors, I won.
3. **Round 2**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost.
5. **Round 4**: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost.
6. **Round 5**: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost.
7. **Round 6**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
8. **Round 7**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
9. **Round 8**: I played paper, opponent played rock, I won.

From this history, we can observe the following:

- The opponent has played rock 5 times, scissors 2 times, and paper 1 time.
- The opponent seems to have a preference for rock, as it has been played most frequently.
- The opponent has not shown a clear pattern of adapting to my plays, as they have repeated rock multiple times in a row (rounds 6, 7, and 8).
- I have received positive rewards when playing paper against the opponent's rock.

Given these observations, my previous hypothesis that the opponent has a preference for rock with occasional scissors and paper seems to hold. The opponent's strategy might be static, favoring rock, which I can exploit by playing paper more frequently.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Preference for rock, with occasional scissors and paper.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
        'my_next_play': 'paper'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's preference for rock, with occasional scissors and paper, and considering that they played rock in the last round, it is likely they will continue with rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Both played scissors, resulting in a tie.
2. **Round 1**: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.
3. **Round 2**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.
5. **Round 4**: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.
6. **Round 5**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
7. **Round 6**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
8. **Round 7**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
9. **Round 8**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
10. **Round 9**: Both played paper, resulting in a tie.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) at least once.
- There are multiple ties, suggesting the opponent might be repeating some plays.
- The opponent played rock three times in a row (rounds 6, 7, 8), which could indicate a pattern or strategy.
- The opponent's plays do not seem to directly counter my previous plays, suggesting they might not be adapting to my strategy.

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent might be using a semi-random or cyclic strategy, possibly favoring rock more frequently. Given the repetition of rock in rounds 6, 7, and 8, they might have a tendency to play rock more often than other choices. However, the pattern is not yet clear enough to be certain.

**Strategy Moving Forward:**

To counter a potential bias towards rock, I should consider playing paper more frequently, as it beats rock.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Semi-random with a possible bias towards rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy seems to have a bias towards rock, and considering the last few rounds where they played rock twice and then paper, it's likely they might return to playing rock again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Both played scissors - Tie.
2. **Round 1**: I played rock, opponent played scissors - I won.
3. **Round 2**: Both played rock - Tie.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, opponent played rock - I lost.
5. **Round 4**: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I lost.
6. **Round 5**: I played rock, opponent played paper - I lost.
7. **Round 6**: Both played rock - Tie.
8. **Round 7**: Both played rock - Tie.
9. **Round 8**: I played paper, opponent played rock - I won.
10. **Round 9**: Both played paper - Tie.
11. **Round 10**: Both played paper - Tie.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times, but there is no clear pattern of cycling through them.
- The opponent has tied with me 6 times out of 11 rounds, suggesting they might be playing a strategy that often results in ties.
- The opponent has played rock 4 times, scissors 2 times, and paper 3 times. This distribution is relatively even, but there is a slight preference for rock.
- When I played rock, I won once, tied twice, and lost once.
- When I played paper, I won once, tied twice, and lost once.
- When I played scissors, I tied once and lost once.

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent seems to have a slight preference for playing rock, but they are not following a strict pattern. They might be using a strategy that slightly favors rock, but also mixes in paper and scissors to avoid predictability.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Slight preference for rock, with occasional paper and scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's slight preference for rock, with occasional paper and scissors, and considering the last two rounds were ties with paper, it is likely that the opponent might switch back to their preferred play, which is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Rounds 0, 2, 6, 7**: The opponent played 'rock' twice and 'scissors' once, resulting in ties when I played the same move.
2. **Round 1**: The opponent played 'scissors', and I won with 'rock'.
3. **Round 3**: The opponent played 'rock', and I lost with 'scissors'.
4. **Round 4**: The opponent played 'scissors', and I lost with 'paper'.
5. **Round 5**: The opponent played 'paper', and I lost with 'rock'.
6. **Round 8**: The opponent played 'rock', and I won with 'paper'.
7. **Rounds 9, 10, 11**: The opponent played 'paper', resulting in ties when I played 'paper'.

From this analysis, it seems that the opponent is not sticking to a single move or a simple repeating pattern. However, there are some observations:
- The opponent has played 'rock' three times, 'scissors' twice, and 'paper' three times.
- The opponent has played 'paper' for the last three rounds consecutively.

Given the recent pattern of playing 'paper' three times in a row, the opponent might be testing a strategy of repeating the same move. However, the overall distribution of moves suggests a more random or mixed strategy rather than a static one.

**Hypothesis**: The opponent might be using a mixed strategy with a recent inclination towards playing 'paper'. This could be a temporary pattern or part of a larger mixed strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Mixed strategy with recent inclination towards paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the recent inclination towards playing paper by the opponent, it is likely that they will continue with this trend and play paper again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my best move would be to play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {12: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Mixed strategy with recent inclination towards paper', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and the outcomes:

1. **Rounds 0-2**: The opponent played scissors, scissors, and rock. I played scissors, rock, and rock, resulting in a tie, a win, and a tie, respectively. This suggests no clear pattern yet.

2. **Rounds 3-5**: The opponent played rock, scissors, and paper. I played scissors, paper, and rock, resulting in a loss, a loss, and a loss. This indicates that the opponent is not sticking to a single move.

3. **Rounds 6-7**: The opponent played rock twice. I played rock both times, resulting in ties. This could suggest a temporary inclination towards rock.

4. **Rounds 8-12**: The opponent played rock, paper, paper, paper, and paper. I played paper, paper, paper, paper, and scissors, resulting in a win, tie, tie, tie, and win. This indicates a recent inclination towards paper.

**Hypothesis Development:**

- The opponent's strategy seems to have shifted towards playing paper more frequently in the recent rounds (8-12). This could be a part of a mixed strategy where the opponent occasionally changes their dominant move.
- The opponent might be using a strategy that favors paper after a series of ties or losses, as seen in rounds 8-12.
- Given the recent success with scissors against paper, it might be beneficial to continue playing scissors unless the opponent changes their pattern.

**Conclusion:**

The opponent appears to be using a mixed strategy with a recent inclination towards playing paper. This could be exploited by playing scissors more frequently until a change in their pattern is observed.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Mixed strategy with recent inclination towards paper',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
        'my_next_play': 'scissors'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's recent inclination towards paper and the fact that they played paper in the last round, it is likely that they will continue with paper in the next round. This is based on the observed pattern where the opponent tends to repeat their play when they have recently played paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Since the predicted opponent's next play is paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Static scissors strategy', 'value': 0.15889545140099998, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Rounds 0 and 13**: Both rounds resulted in a tie with both players choosing scissors. This suggests that the opponent might have a tendency to play scissors.

2. **Round 1**: I played rock and won against the opponent's scissors. This supports the hypothesis that the opponent might favor scissors.

3. **Round 2**: Both players chose rock, resulting in a tie. This does not provide much information about a pattern.

4. **Round 3**: I played scissors and lost to the opponent's rock. This suggests the opponent might occasionally switch to rock.

5. **Round 4**: I played paper and lost to the opponent's scissors. This reinforces the idea that the opponent might favor scissors.

6. **Round 5**: I played rock and lost to the opponent's paper. This indicates the opponent might also play paper occasionally.

7. **Rounds 6 and 7**: Both rounds resulted in ties with both players choosing rock. This suggests the opponent might also play rock sometimes.

8. **Round 8**: I played paper and won against the opponent's rock. This suggests the opponent might play rock occasionally.

9. **Rounds 9, 10, and 11**: All rounds resulted in ties with both players choosing paper. This suggests the opponent might also play paper sometimes.

10. **Round 12**: I played scissors and won against the opponent's paper. This suggests the opponent might play paper occasionally.

From this analysis, the opponent seems to favor scissors but occasionally plays rock and paper. The hypothesis that the opponent is playing a static scissors strategy is somewhat supported, but they also seem to mix in other plays. The opponent's strategy might be a mix of scissors with occasional rock and paper plays.

Given the interaction history, I have received positive rewards when playing rock against scissors and scissors against paper. This suggests that the opponent might be playing a strategy that favors scissors but occasionally switches to rock or paper.

**Hypothesis Summary:**
```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Mixed strategy favoring scissors with occasional rock and paper plays',
    'value': 0.15889545140099998,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's mixed strategy favoring scissors with occasional rock and paper plays, and considering the last two rounds where they played scissors, it is likely they might continue with scissors. However, there is also a possibility they might switch to rock or paper to break the pattern. Given the history, the opponent might play scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the likely play of scissors by the opponent, my best move would be to play rock, as it beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Static scissors strategy', 'value': 0.4112268159807, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 14: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Mixed strategy favoring scissors with occasional rock and paper plays', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - **Rounds 0, 13:** Opponent played scissors, resulting in a tie.
   - **Rounds 1, 14:** Opponent played scissors, and I played rock, resulting in a win.
   - **Round 3:** Opponent played rock, and I played scissors, resulting in a loss.
   - **Round 4:** Opponent played scissors, and I played paper, resulting in a loss.
   - **Round 5:** Opponent played paper, and I played rock, resulting in a loss.
   - **Rounds 6, 7:** Opponent played rock, resulting in a tie.
   - **Round 8:** Opponent played rock, and I played paper, resulting in a win.
   - **Rounds 9, 10, 11:** Opponent played paper, resulting in a tie.
   - **Round 12:** Opponent played paper, and I played scissors, resulting in a win.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - **Round 2 Hypothesis:** "Static scissors strategy" with a prediction of scissors as the next play.
   - **Round 14 Hypothesis:** "Mixed strategy favoring scissors with occasional rock and paper plays" with a prediction of scissors as the next play.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - The opponent has played scissors multiple times (rounds 0, 1, 4, 13, 14), which aligns with the "Static scissors strategy" hypothesis.
   - However, the opponent has also played rock (rounds 3, 6, 7, 8) and paper (rounds 5, 9, 10, 11, 12), indicating variability in their strategy.
   - The mixed strategy hypothesis seems more fitting, as it accounts for the occasional rock and paper plays while still favoring scissors.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing rock against scissors (rounds 1, 14) and scissors against paper (round 12).
   - Negative rewards were obtained when playing scissors against rock (round 3) and rock against paper (round 5).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a mixed strategy that favors scissors but occasionally plays rock and paper. This aligns with the hypothesis from round 14.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit the tendency of the opponent to favor scissors by playing rock, while being cautious of their occasional rock and paper plays.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Mixed strategy favoring scissors with occasional rock and paper plays'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's mixed strategy favoring scissors with occasional rock and paper plays, and considering that I last played rock which won against their scissors, they might switch to paper to counter my rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the likelihood that the opponent will play paper to counter my rock, my best play should be scissors to beat their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Rounds 0, 13**: Both players played 'scissors', resulting in a tie.
2. **Rounds 1, 14**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a win for me.
3. **Rounds 2, 6, 7**: Both players played 'rock', resulting in a tie.
4. **Round 3, 15**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock', resulting in a loss for me.
5. **Round 4**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a loss for me.
6. **Round 5**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper', resulting in a loss for me.
7. **Round 8**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock', resulting in a win for me.
8. **Rounds 9, 10, 11**: Both players played 'paper', resulting in a tie.
9. **Round 12**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper', resulting in a win for me.

From this analysis, we can observe the following patterns:
- The opponent has played 'rock' in rounds 2, 6, 7, 15.
- The opponent has played 'scissors' in rounds 0, 1, 4, 13.
- The opponent has played 'paper' in rounds 5, 9, 10, 11.

The opponent seems to play each option ('rock', 'paper', 'scissors') with some regularity, but there is no clear pattern of cycling through them in a predictable order. However, they have repeated 'rock' and 'paper' more frequently in recent rounds.

**Hypothesis**: The opponent might be using a strategy that involves repeating 'rock' and 'paper' more frequently, with occasional 'scissors'. This could be a semi-random strategy with a slight preference for 'rock' and 'paper'.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Semi-random with a slight preference for rock and paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of being semi-random with a slight preference for rock and paper, and considering their last play was rock, it is likely they might continue with rock or switch to paper. However, given the slight preference for rock and paper, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {14: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Mixed strategy favoring scissors with occasional rock and paper plays', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and look for patterns:

1. **Rounds 0-3**: 
   - Opponent played scissors twice and rock once. 
   - My plays: scissors, rock, rock, scissors.
   - Rewards: 0, 3, 0, -1.

2. **Rounds 4-7**:
   - Opponent played scissors, paper, rock, rock.
   - My plays: paper, rock, rock, rock.
   - Rewards: -1, -1, 0, 0.

3. **Rounds 8-11**:
   - Opponent played rock, paper, paper, paper.
   - My plays: paper, paper, paper, paper.
   - Rewards: 3, 0, 0, 0.

4. **Rounds 12-15**:
   - Opponent played paper, scissors, scissors, rock.
   - My plays: scissors, scissors, rock, scissors.
   - Rewards: 3, 0, 3, -1.

5. **Round 16**:
   - Opponent played scissors.
   - My play: paper.
   - Reward: -1.

**Pattern Analysis**:
- The opponent seems to favor scissors, as it has been played in rounds 0, 4, 13, and 16.
- Rock has been played in rounds 2, 6, 7, and 15.
- Paper has been played in rounds 5, 9, 10, 11, and 12.

**Hypothesis**:
The opponent's strategy appears to be a mixed strategy with a slight favor towards scissors, occasionally playing rock and paper. This aligns with the previous hypothesis at round 14. The opponent's plays do not seem to adapt based on my actions, suggesting a static mixed strategy.

**Reward Analysis**:
- Positive rewards when playing rock against scissors.
- Negative rewards when playing paper against scissors.
- Neutral rewards when both play the same.

**Strategy**:
To counter this, I should favor playing rock more frequently, as it counters the opponent's favored scissors play.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Mixed strategy favoring scissors with occasional rock and paper plays'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's mixed strategy favoring scissors with occasional rock and paper plays, and considering they just played scissors, it is likely they might continue with scissors or switch to rock to counter my paper play.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors or rock, I should play rock. Rock will beat scissors and tie with rock, minimizing potential loss.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Rounds 0-2**: 
   - Opponent plays: Scissors, Scissors, Rock
   - My plays: Scissors, Rock, Rock
   - Outcomes: Tie, Win, Tie

2. **Rounds 3-5**: 
   - Opponent plays: Rock, Scissors, Paper
   - My plays: Scissors, Paper, Rock
   - Outcomes: Loss, Loss, Loss

3. **Rounds 6-8**: 
   - Opponent plays: Rock, Rock, Rock

4. **Rounds 9-11**: 
   - Opponent plays: Paper, Paper, Paper
   - My plays: Paper, Paper, Paper

5. **Rounds 12-14**: 
   - Opponent plays: Paper, Scissors, Scissors
   - My plays: Scissors, Scissors, Rock

6. **Rounds 15-17**: 
   - Opponent plays: Rock, Scissors, Paper
   - My plays: Scissors, Paper, Rock
   - Outcomes: Loss, Loss, Loss

**Observations:**
- The opponent seems to play each option (Rock, Paper, Scissors) in blocks or sequences.
- There are sequences where the opponent repeats the same move multiple times (e.g., Rock in rounds 6-8, Paper in rounds 9-11).
- The opponent's strategy might involve cycling through moves or playing in blocks of repeated moves.

**Hypothesis:**
The opponent might be employing a strategy where they cycle through each move (Rock, Paper, Scissors) in blocks, repeating the same move for a few rounds before switching to the next one. This pattern suggests a non-random, possibly cyclic or block-based strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Block-based cycling through Rock, Paper, Scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's block-based cycling strategy through Rock, Paper, Scissors, and their last play being paper, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely next play is scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Rounds 0, 13**: Both players played scissors, resulting in a tie.
2. **Rounds 1, 14**: I played rock and won against the opponent's scissors.
3. **Rounds 2, 6, 7, 18**: Both players played rock, resulting in a tie.
4. **Rounds 3, 15**: I played scissors and lost to the opponent's rock.
5. **Rounds 4, 16**: I played paper and lost to the opponent's scissors.
6. **Rounds 5, 17**: I played rock and lost to the opponent's paper.
7. **Rounds 8**: I played paper and won against the opponent's rock.
8. **Rounds 9, 10, 11**: Both players played paper, resulting in a tie.
9. **Rounds 12**: I played scissors and won against the opponent's paper.

From this analysis, we can observe the following patterns:

- The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times, but there is no clear pattern of repetition or sequence.
- The opponent's plays seem to be distributed across all three options without a clear preference or pattern.
- When I played rock, I won twice (against scissors) and lost twice (against paper), and tied twice (against rock).
- When I played paper, I won once (against rock), lost twice (against scissors), and tied three times (against paper).
- When I played scissors, I won once (against paper), lost twice (against rock), and tied twice (against scissors).

Given this information, the opponent's strategy appears to be somewhat random or evenly distributed across the three options. There is no clear indication of a static strategy or a pattern that can be easily exploited.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is that the opponent is playing a random strategy, selecting rock, paper, or scissors with no discernible pattern.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'random'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent's strategy is random, their next play could be any of rock, paper, or scissors with equal probability. However, they have played rock in the last two rounds, so there might be a slight tendency towards rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the slight tendency towards rock, my next play should be paper to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```
