Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0 Analysis**:
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - My reward: -1 (I lost)

Given this single round of interaction, the opponent played scissors against my paper, resulting in my loss. With only one round of data, it's challenging to determine a definitive strategy for the opponent. However, we can consider a few possibilities:

- **Static Strategy**: The opponent might be playing a static strategy where they consistently choose scissors. If this is the case, I can counter by playing rock in the next rounds to gain a positive reward.

- **Random Strategy**: The opponent might be choosing randomly, and this round was just an instance where they happened to play scissors.

- **Adaptive Strategy**: Although less likely with only one round, the opponent might be trying to adapt to my play. However, with no prior data, this is speculative.

Since I received a negative reward when playing paper, and assuming the opponent might be playing a static strategy of scissors, I can counter this by playing rock in the next rounds. However, I need more data to confirm this hypothesis.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Possibly static scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent played scissors in the last round and my previous guess was that they might be using a static scissors strategy, I believe their next play will likely be scissors again.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play scissors again, I should play rock to counter their move and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: 
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - My reward: -1 (loss)

2. **Round 1**: 
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - My reward: -1 (loss)

From these two rounds, we can observe the following:

- In Round 0, I played Paper and the opponent played Scissors, which beats Paper. This resulted in a loss for me.
- In Round 1, I switched to Rock, and the opponent played Paper, which beats Rock. This also resulted in a loss for me.

The opponent has played Scissors and Paper in the first two rounds. There is no clear pattern yet, but they have successfully countered my plays both times. This could suggest that the opponent might be playing a strategy that anticipates my moves or simply a random strategy that happened to counter mine.

Given the limited data, it's difficult to definitively determine the opponent's strategy. However, if the opponent continues to play in a way that counters my moves, they might be using a strategy that predicts my next move based on my previous plays.

To counter this, I should consider playing Scissors in the next round, as it would beat Paper if the opponent continues with the same play. However, this is a tentative hypothesis, and I will need more data to confirm any specific strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'No clear pattern yet; possibly countering my moves. Consider testing with Scissors next.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent has played paper after I played rock, it seems they might be countering my moves. Since I last played rock, they might expect me to play rock again and could play scissors to counter my potential paper play.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent might play scissors expecting me to play paper, I should play rock to counter their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0:**
   - My play: Paper
   - Opponent's play: Scissors
   - My reward: -1 (loss)
   - Observation: The opponent played Scissors, which beats my Paper.

2. **Round 1:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Paper
   - My reward: -1 (loss)
   - Observation: The opponent played Paper, which beats my Rock.

3. **Round 2:**
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - My reward: 0 (tie)
   - Observation: The opponent played Rock, resulting in a tie.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- In the first round, the opponent played Scissors, which beats Paper.
- In the second round, the opponent played Paper, which beats Rock.
- In the third round, the opponent played Rock, resulting in a tie with my Rock.

The opponent has played each of Rock, Paper, and Scissors once in the first three rounds. This suggests that the opponent might be cycling through the three options in order. If this pattern continues, the opponent's next play could be Scissors, following the sequence: Scissors -> Paper -> Rock.

**Hypothesis:**
The opponent is likely using a cyclic strategy, playing Scissors, Paper, and then Rock in sequence.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the guess that the opponent's strategy is 'cyclic_spr', where they cycle through scissors, paper, and rock, their last play was rock. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely next play is scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's look at the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors'. I received a reward of -1. This suggests the opponent's play was effective against my choice.

2. **Round 1**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I received a reward of -1. Again, the opponent's play was effective against my choice.

3. **Round 2**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. I received a reward of 0. This was a tie.

4. **Round 3**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. I received a reward of 0. This was another tie.

From this, we can observe:

- The opponent played 'scissors' in round 0, 'paper' in round 1, and 'rock' in rounds 2 and 3.
- The opponent's choices have been 'scissors', 'paper', 'rock', 'rock'.

Hypothesis:
- The opponent might be cycling through 'scissors', 'paper', 'rock', and then repeating 'rock'. This could be a pattern or a static strategy.
- Alternatively, the opponent might be trying to counter my previous plays, but the repetition of 'rock' suggests a potential pattern.

Given this hypothesis, if the opponent continues this pattern, they might play 'scissors' next. To counter this, I should play 'rock'.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Pattern of scissors, paper, rock, rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's pattern of scissors, paper, rock, rock, I predict their next play will be scissors, as the pattern seems to be repeating.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. Round 0: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors'. I lost, indicating the opponent's choice of 'scissors' beats my 'paper'.
2. Round 1: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost again, indicating the opponent's choice of 'paper' beats my 'rock'.
3. Round 2: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. It was a tie.
4. Round 3: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. It was a tie again.
5. Round 4: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. Another tie.

From this history, the opponent's plays have been: 'scissors', 'paper', 'rock', 'rock', 'rock'. 

Observations:
- The opponent started with 'scissors', then 'paper', and has been consistently playing 'rock' for the last three rounds.
- My reward has been negative or zero, indicating that my current strategy of playing 'rock' is not effective.
- The opponent might be using a strategy that involves repeating 'rock' after an initial sequence of 'scissors' and 'paper'.

Hypothesis:
- The opponent might be using a strategy where they cycle through 'scissors', 'paper', and then stick with 'rock' for several rounds.
- Alternatively, they might have switched to a static strategy of playing 'rock' after the first two rounds.

Given this hypothesis, the best counter-strategy would be to play 'paper', which beats 'rock'.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Initial cycle of scissors, paper, then static rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent initially cycled through scissors and paper and is now consistently playing rock, I believe their next play will continue to be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play rock again, I should play paper to counter it and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {5: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Initial cycle of scissors, paper, then static rock', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 1: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Possibly static scissors', 'value': 0.1880699999999999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history:

1. Round 0: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.
2. Round 1: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
3. Round 2: I played rock, opponent played rock. It's a tie.
4. Round 3: I played rock, opponent played rock. It's a tie.
5. Round 4: I played rock, opponent played rock. It's a tie.
6. Round 5: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.

From this history, we can observe the following:

- The opponent played scissors in round 0, paper in round 1, and rock in rounds 2, 3, 4, and 5.
- The opponent's choice seems to have stabilized to rock from round 2 onwards.
- My choice of rock resulted in ties from rounds 2 to 4, and my switch to paper in round 5 resulted in a win.

Given this pattern, it seems the opponent might be using a static strategy of consistently playing rock after the initial rounds. This could be due to a fixed strategy or a simple pattern that doesn't adapt to my plays.

To exploit this, I should continue playing paper, as it beats rock, which seems to be the opponent's current strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Static Rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a static rock strategy, I believe their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a static rock strategy, I believe my next play should be paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors'. I lost (-1 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost (-1 reward).
3. **Round 2**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. It was a tie (0 reward).
4. **Round 3**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. It was a tie (0 reward).
5. **Round 4**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. It was a tie (0 reward).
6. **Round 5**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I won (3 reward).
7. **Round 6**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper'. It was a tie (0 reward).

From this history, we can observe the following:

- The opponent played 'scissors' once, 'paper' once, and 'rock' three times consecutively, followed by 'rock' and 'paper'.
- The opponent's plays do not seem to follow a simple repeating pattern like 'rock-paper-scissors'.
- The opponent played 'rock' three times in a row (rounds 2, 3, and 4), which could indicate a preference or a temporary strategy.
- In round 5, I played 'paper' and won against 'rock', but in round 6, the opponent switched to 'paper', resulting in a tie.

Based on this, the opponent might be using a strategy that involves repeating 'rock' multiple times, with occasional switches to 'paper' or 'scissors'. However, the pattern is not entirely clear yet, and it might be too early to conclude a static strategy.

Given the limited data, a cautious hypothesis is that the opponent might be favoring 'rock' but is not strictly adhering to it. They might be using a semi-random strategy with a slight bias towards 'rock'.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Semi-random with a slight bias towards rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy is semi-random with a slight bias towards rock, and considering the recent plays, it is likely that they might continue with their bias towards rock or switch to another option. However, since they played paper last, they might switch back to rock to maintain their bias.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors'. I lost (-1 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost (-1 reward).
3. **Round 2**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. It was a tie (0 reward).
4. **Round 3**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. It was a tie (0 reward).
5. **Round 4**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. It was a tie (0 reward).
6. **Round 5**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I won (3 reward).
7. **Round 6**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper'. It was a tie (0 reward).
8. **Round 7**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper'. It was a tie (0 reward).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played 'rock' three times in a row (rounds 2, 3, 4) and 'paper' three times in a row (rounds 6, 7, 1).
- The opponent played 'scissors' once (round 0).
- The opponent's pattern seems to involve repeating the same move multiple times before switching.
- The opponent's sequence so far: scissors, paper, rock, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, paper.
- The opponent might be cycling through the moves in a specific order or repeating moves for a few rounds before switching.

**Hypothesis:**
The opponent seems to be following a pattern where they repeat a move for a few rounds before switching to another move. They might be cycling through 'scissors', 'paper', and 'rock' in a sequence, or they might be using a pattern like 'scissors', 'paper', 'rock', 'rock', 'rock', 'paper', 'paper', 'paper'.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Repeats the same move multiple times before switching, possibly cycling through scissors, paper, and rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent has repeated their move multiple times before switching, and they have played 'paper' for the last two rounds, it is likely they will switch to 'scissors' next, following a potential cycle of scissors, paper, rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost (-1 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost (-1 reward).
3. **Round 2**: I played rock, opponent played rock. It's a tie (0 reward).
4. **Round 3**: I played rock, opponent played rock. It's a tie (0 reward).
5. **Round 4**: I played rock, opponent played rock. It's a tie (0 reward).
6. **Round 5**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won (3 reward).
7. **Round 6**: I played paper, opponent played paper. It's a tie (0 reward).
8. **Round 7**: I played paper, opponent played paper. It's a tie (0 reward).
9. **Round 8**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost (-1 reward).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played scissors, paper, and rock at least once.
- The opponent played rock three times consecutively (rounds 2, 3, and 4), then switched to paper for three consecutive rounds (rounds 6, 7, and 8).
- The opponent's pattern seems to involve repeating the same move for a few rounds before switching.
- When I played rock, I tied or lost, indicating the opponent often plays paper or rock.
- When I played paper, I won once and tied twice, suggesting the opponent might play rock or paper more frequently.

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent seems to follow a pattern where they play the same move for several rounds before switching. They might be alternating between rock and paper, with occasional scissors. Given the recent pattern, they might continue with paper or switch back to rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Repeats the same move for several rounds before switching. Recently alternating between rock and paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of repeating the same move for several rounds before switching, and their recent pattern of alternating between rock and paper, it is likely that their next play will be rock, as they played paper in the last round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors'. I lost (-1 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost (-1 reward).
3. **Round 2**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. Tie (0 reward).
4. **Round 3**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. Tie (0 reward).
5. **Round 4**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. Tie (0 reward).
6. **Round 5**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I won (3 reward).
7. **Round 6**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper'. Tie (0 reward).
8. **Round 7**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper'. Tie (0 reward).
9. **Round 8**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost (-1 reward).
10. **Round 9**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I won (3 reward).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played 'rock' in rounds 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9.
- The opponent has played 'paper' in rounds 1, 6, 7, and 8.
- The opponent has played 'scissors' in round 0.

From this, it seems like the opponent might be alternating between 'rock' and 'paper' with a single instance of 'scissors' at the start. However, the pattern is not entirely consistent, as the opponent repeated 'rock' for three consecutive rounds (2, 3, 4) and 'paper' for two consecutive rounds (6, 7).

The opponent's strategy could be a simple alternating pattern between 'rock' and 'paper', with occasional deviations. Given this, playing 'paper' seems to yield positive rewards when the opponent plays 'rock', and playing 'scissors' could be beneficial when the opponent plays 'paper'.

**Hypothesis:**
The opponent might be alternating between 'rock' and 'paper' with occasional deviations. Playing 'paper' has been beneficial when the opponent plays 'rock', and playing 'scissors' could counter their 'paper' plays.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Alternating between rock and paper with occasional deviations'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of alternating between rock and paper with occasional deviations, and considering their last play was rock, it is likely that their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {9: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Repeats the same move for several rounds before switching. Recently alternating between rock and paper.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Alternating between rock and paper with occasional deviations', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their plays and my corresponding rewards:

1. **Round 0**: Opponent played scissors, I played paper, I lost (-1).
2. **Round 1**: Opponent played paper, I played rock, I lost (-1).
3. **Round 2**: Opponent played rock, I played rock, tie (0).
4. **Round 3**: Opponent played rock, I played rock, tie (0).
5. **Round 4**: Opponent played rock, I played rock, tie (0).
6. **Round 5**: Opponent played rock, I played paper, I won (3).
7. **Round 6**: Opponent played paper, I played paper, tie (0).
8. **Round 7**: Opponent played paper, I played paper, tie (0).
9. **Round 8**: Opponent played paper, I played rock, I lost (-1).
10. **Round 9**: Opponent played rock, I played paper, I won (3).
11. **Round 10**: Opponent played paper, I played scissors, I won (3).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent's plays seem to cycle between rock and paper, with one instance of scissors at the very beginning.
- In rounds 2, 3, 4, and 5, the opponent played rock consecutively, suggesting a possible pattern or cycle.
- In rounds 6, 7, and 8, the opponent switched to paper, again suggesting a pattern.
- The opponent's play in round 9 was rock, and in round 10 was paper, indicating a possible alternating pattern between rock and paper.
- My rewards are positive when I play paper against rock and scissors against paper.

**Hypothesis:**
The opponent seems to be alternating between rock and paper after an initial play of scissors. This suggests a simple alternating strategy between rock and paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Alternating between rock and paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the pattern of alternating between rock and paper, and considering the last play was paper, I predict that the opponent's next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Rounds 0-2**: 
   - I played 'paper', 'rock', 'rock'.
   - Opponent played 'scissors', 'paper', 'rock'.
   - My rewards: -1, -1, 0.
   - The opponent played 'scissors', 'paper', 'rock' in sequence.

2. **Rounds 3-5**:
   - I played 'rock', 'rock', 'paper'.
   - Opponent played 'rock', 'rock', 'rock'.
   - My rewards: 0, 0, 3.
   - The opponent played 'rock' consistently.

3. **Rounds 6-8**:
   - I played 'paper', 'paper', 'rock'.
   - Opponent played 'paper', 'paper', 'paper'.
   - My rewards: 0, 0, -1.
   - The opponent played 'paper' consistently.

4. **Rounds 9-11**:
   - I played 'paper', 'scissors', 'paper'.
   - Opponent played 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors'.
   - My rewards: 3, 3, -1.
   - The opponent played 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors' in sequence.

**Analysis**:
- The opponent seems to have a pattern of playing the same move for a few rounds before switching to a different move.
- Initially, they played 'scissors', 'paper', 'rock' in sequence, then switched to 'rock' for three rounds, followed by 'paper' for three rounds, and then 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors' again.
- This suggests a possible cyclic pattern or a strategy of repeating moves for a few rounds before switching.

**Hypothesis**:
The opponent might be using a strategy where they repeat a move for a few rounds and then switch to another move, possibly cycling through 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors'. This could be a simple cyclic strategy or a more complex pattern that repeats after a few rounds.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Repeats a move for a few rounds before switching, possibly cycling through rock, paper, scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent tends to repeat a move for a few rounds before switching, and they played scissors in the last round, I believe their next play will likely be scissors again.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play scissors, I should play rock to counter it.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their plays and our outcomes:

1. **Round 0**: Opponent played scissors, I played paper, I lost (-1).
2. **Round 1**: Opponent played paper, I played rock, I lost (-1).
3. **Round 2**: Opponent played rock, I played rock, tie (0).
4. **Round 3**: Opponent played rock, I played rock, tie (0).
5. **Round 4**: Opponent played rock, I played rock, tie (0).
6. **Round 5**: Opponent played rock, I played paper, I won (+3).
7. **Round 6**: Opponent played paper, I played paper, tie (0).
8. **Round 7**: Opponent played paper, I played paper, tie (0).
9. **Round 8**: Opponent played paper, I played rock, I lost (-1).
10. **Round 9**: Opponent played rock, I played paper, I won (+3).
11. **Round 10**: Opponent played paper, I played scissors, I won (+3).
12. **Round 11**: Opponent played scissors, I played paper, I lost (-1).
13. **Round 12**: Opponent played paper, I played rock, I lost (-1).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played each of rock, paper, and scissors multiple times.
- They have played rock in rounds 2, 3, 4, 5, and 9.
- They have played paper in rounds 1, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12.
- They have played scissors in rounds 0 and 11.

The opponent seems to switch between rock and paper more frequently, with occasional scissors. There is no clear pattern of alternating or cycling through the options. However, paper has been played more frequently than the others in recent rounds.

**Hypothesis:**
The opponent might be favoring paper slightly more often than rock or scissors. This could be a static strategy or a simple pattern that isn't immediately obvious. Given this, playing scissors might yield more positive outcomes if this trend continues.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Favors paper slightly more often, with occasional rock and scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of favoring paper slightly more often, and considering their recent plays, it is likely that they will continue with paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors, as it beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 6, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 7, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 9, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 10, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 11, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 12, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 13, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}].
            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Mixed strategy with a slight bias towards rock and paper'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {9: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Repeats the same move for several rounds before switching. Recently alternating between rock and paper.', 'value': 0.11793000000000003, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Alternating between rock and paper with occasional deviations', 'value': 0.045899999999999996, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To hypothesize the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.
2. **Round 1**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
3. **Round 2**: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie.
4. **Round 3**: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie.
5. **Round 4**: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie.
6. **Round 5**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
7. **Round 6**: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.
8. **Round 7**: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.
9. **Round 8**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
10. **Round 9**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
11. **Round 10**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
12. **Round 11**: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.
13. **Round 12**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
14. **Round 13**: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times, but there doesn't seem to be a simple repeating pattern like "rock, paper, scissors" or a static choice.
- The opponent has played rock 5 times, paper 5 times, and scissors 3 times.
- When I played rock, I lost twice, tied three times, and never won.
- When I played paper, I won twice, tied twice, and lost twice.
- When I played scissors, I won once and lost twice.

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent seems to be playing a mixed strategy, not sticking to a single move or a simple repeating pattern. However, they have played rock and paper more frequently than scissors. This could suggest a slight bias towards rock and paper, but it's not definitive. Given this, a strategy that favors paper might be slightly advantageous, as it beats rock and ties with paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Mixed strategy with a slight bias towards rock and paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's mixed strategy with a slight bias towards rock and paper, and considering their recent plays, it is likely that they will play rock again in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```
