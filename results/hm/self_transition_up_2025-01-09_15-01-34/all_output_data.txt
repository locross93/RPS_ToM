                An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 0, {'round': 0, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}.
                The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}].
                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the first interaction, my opponent played "rock" and I played "scissors," resulting in a negative reward for me. This suggests that my opponent's likely policy is to play a move that beats my previous move. In this case, they played "rock" to beat my "scissors." This indicates a potential static strategy where my opponent consistently plays a move that beats my previous move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'counter_previous_move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is 'counter_previous_move' and they played 'rock' in the last round, they are likely to continue countering my previous move and play 'paper' in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'paper' in the next round, I should play 'scissors' to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {1: {'Opponent_strategy': 'counter_previous_move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is playing a strategy of countering my previous move. In the first round, I played scissors and my opponent played paper, resulting in a positive reward for me. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy and I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

Hypothesis:
My opponent's likely policy is to counter my previous move with a static strategy.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'counter_previous_move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is to counter the previous move, and considering that I played scissors in the last round, the opponent's likely play in the next round will be rock to counter my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely play in the next round will be rock, my next play should be paper to counter their move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```
