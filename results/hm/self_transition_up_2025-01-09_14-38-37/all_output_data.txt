                An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 0, {'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}.
                The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}].
                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the first interaction, my opponent played "scissors" and I played "rock," resulting in a positive reward for me. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy where they consistently play "scissors." Given this, I can exploit this by consistently playing "rock" to counter their strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'consistently plays scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent consistently plays scissors, it is likely that they will continue to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of scissors, you should play rock in the next round to beat their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the first two rounds, it seems that the opponent's play is not influenced by my play, as they played 'scissors' and 'rock' in response to my 'rock' plays. This suggests that the opponent may be using a static strategy, rather than adapting to my choices. Since I received a positive reward when playing 'rock' and a neutral reward when playing 'rock' again, it's possible that the opponent is playing a static strategy that does not change based on my choices.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'static'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy seems to be static and they played rock in the last round, it is likely that they will continue to play rock in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, you should play paper in the next round to counter their play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Given the interaction history, it seems that the opponent's plays have resulted in a tie in the first two rounds. This suggests that the opponent may be playing a static strategy, as they are not adapting to my plays. Since we have tied twice, it's likely that the opponent is not consistently countering my plays.

Based on this, my hypothesis is that the opponent is playing a static strategy, possibly choosing their plays randomly or based on a fixed pattern.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'static'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is static and they have played paper in the last round, it is likely that they will continue to play paper in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Considering the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors to beat their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
