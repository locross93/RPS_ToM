                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the first interaction, my opponent played "rock" and I played "scissors," resulting in a negative reward for me. This suggests that my opponent's likely policy is to play a move that beats my previous move. In this case, they played "rock" to beat my "scissors." 

Hypothesis:
My opponent's likely strategy is to play the move that beats my previous move.

```python

'Opponent_strategy': 'counter_previous_move'

```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {1: {'Opponent_strategy': 'counter_previous_move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent's likely policy is to counter the previous move. In the first round, they played rock in response to my scissors, and in the second round, they played paper in response to my scissors. This suggests that they are playing a strategy to counter my previous move.

Hypothesis:
The opponent's likely strategy is to counter the previous move with a specific play. They are playing a static strategy that directly responds to my previous move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'counter_previous_move',
'value': 0.3,
'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of "counter_previous_move" and the fact that they played "paper" in the last round, they are likely to play "scissors" in the next round to counter your previous move of "scissors".

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of "scissors", your next play should be "rock" to beat their expected move.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent is employing a "counter previous move" strategy. Here's the step by step reasoning:

1. In round 0, my play was scissors and the opponent's play was rock, resulting in a negative reward for me. This suggests that the opponent may be countering my previous move.

2. In round 1, my play was scissors and the opponent's play was paper, resulting in a positive reward for me. This further supports the hypothesis that the opponent is countering my previous move.

3. In round 2, my play was rock and the opponent's play was scissors, resulting in a positive reward for me. This reinforces the idea that the opponent is consistently countering my previous move.

Given this pattern, it is likely that the opponent is following a static strategy of countering the previous move consistently.

Summary:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'counter_previous_move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is to counter the previous move, their likely play in the next round will be paper, as they lost to your rock and may try to counter it with paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, your next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent is consistently countering my previous move. In the first round, I played scissors and the opponent played rock, resulting in a negative reward. In the second round, I played scissors again and the opponent played paper, resulting in a positive reward. In the third round, I switched to rock and the opponent countered with scissors, resulting in a positive reward for me.

Given this pattern, it appears that the opponent is consistently countering my previous move. This is supported by the previous hypotheses, which indicated that the opponent's likely next play would be rock when my next play is paper.

Therefore, the opponent's likely policy is to counter my previous move consistently.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'counter_previous_move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is "counter_previous_move" and they played rock in the previous round, they are likely to play paper in the next round to counter your scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, your next play should be rock to counter their expected paper.
