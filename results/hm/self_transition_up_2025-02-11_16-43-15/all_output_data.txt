Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Given the first interaction where my opponent played "scissors" and I played "rock", I received a positive reward of 3. This indicates that my opponent is not playing a static strategy, as they did not consistently play the same move. 

At this point, it's difficult to determine my opponent's likely policy with just one interaction. However, based on the limited data, it seems that my opponent may not be adapting their strategy to counter mine, as they played "scissors" which is weak against my "rock". 

I will need more interactions to form a more accurate hypothesis about my opponent's strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Not enough data to determine'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent played scissors in the last round and assuming they do not change their strategy, their likely play in the next round would be scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, your next play should be rock to beat their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Given the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not consistently playing the same choice. In the first round, they played scissors, and in the second round, they played rock. This indicates that they may not be following a static strategy.

I am not consistently getting positive or negative rewards when playing the same choice, which suggests that my opponent is not playing a static strategy. It's possible that they are using a random or non-deterministic strategy.

Based on the limited data, it's difficult to form a specific hypothesis about my opponent's strategy. However, it seems that they may not be following a simple deterministic pattern. It's possible that they are playing randomly or using a more complex strategy that is not easily discernible from the limited data.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Non-deterministic or random'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is non-deterministic or random, it is difficult to predict their next play based on the previous rounds. However, considering the previous plays, there is an equal chance for the opponent to play rock, paper, or scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the uncertainty of the opponent's next play, it is best to play a strategy that maximizes the chances of winning against any possible play. In this case, playing rock would be a safe option as it can tie with the opponent's potential rock play and beat their potential scissors play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent's likely policy is to play a winning move against my previous choice. In the first round, I played rock and my opponent played scissors, resulting in a positive reward for me. In the second round, I played rock again and my opponent played paper, resulting in a negative reward for me. This indicates that my opponent is likely playing a static strategy to counter my previous move.

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent's plays are not entirely random. They played scissors twice in a row, which suggests a pattern. Additionally, in the last round, they played scissors after I played rock, indicating a potential counter strategy.

Given this, I hypothesize that the opponent's strategy is to counter my previous move. This is supported by the fact that they played scissors after my rock, which is a counter to rock. The opponent's likely policy is to play the move that beats my previous move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Counter_previous_move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is 'Counter_previous_move' and they played 'scissors' in the last round, they are likely to play 'rock' in the next round to counter your 'rock' play.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', your next play should be 'paper'.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Counter_previous_move', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Non-deterministic or random', 'value': 0.363, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent is playing a strategy that counters my previous move. In the last round, I played "paper" and the opponent played "scissors," resulting in a negative reward for me. This suggests that the opponent is likely playing a strategy that counters my previous move.

Considering the previous hypotheses, it's evident that the opponent's strategy is focused on countering my previous move rather than following a deterministic or random pattern. This is supported by the fact that my reward has been negative when playing the same choice as the previous round.

Therefore, the opponent's likely policy is to counter my previous move, indicating a dynamic strategy that adapts to my plays.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Counter_previous_move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is "Counter_previous_move" and they played scissors in the last round, they are likely to play rock in the next round to counter your paper play.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, you should play paper in the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent is playing a strategy of countering the previous move. In the last three rounds, they have consistently played a move that would counter my previous move. For example, when I played rock, they played scissors; when I played paper, they played scissors. This suggests that they might be trying to counter my previous move.

Given this pattern, my opponent's likely policy is to counter my previous move. This means that if I continue to play the same move, I will likely get a positive reward as they are countering my previous move. Therefore, it seems that my opponent may be playing a static strategy and I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Counter_previous_move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is "Counter_previous_move" and they played rock in the last round, they might likely play scissors in the next round to counter your paper play.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of scissors in the next round, your next play should be rock to counter their expected move.

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent's likely policy is to play a counter strategy. They played paper after I played rock, which resulted in a negative reward for me. This suggests that they may be playing a static strategy to counter my moves. Given this, my opponent's likely policy is to play the move that beats my previous move.

```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of "Counter" and the fact that they played "paper" in the last round, it is likely that they will play "scissors" in the next round to counter your "rock" play.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of "scissors," your next play should be "rock" to beat their expected move.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent's likely policy is to play a counter strategy. They played "scissors" when I played "rock" and "paper" when I played "rock," which indicates a pattern of countering my previous move. This suggests that they may be playing a static strategy to counter my choices.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'counter'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is 'counter' and they have played 'paper' after your 'rock' in the last round, it is likely that they will continue to play 'paper' to counter your rock play.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'paper', your next play should be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {7: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Counter', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {7: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Counter', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent's strategy is not static, as they have played different moves in response to my previous moves. However, in the last interaction, they played the same move as me (scissors), resulting in a tie. This suggests that they might be trying to counter my previous move.

Given this, my hypothesis is that the opponent is using a reactive strategy, attempting to counter my previous move. This is supported by the fact that they played the same move as me in the last round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive',
'value': 0.09000000000000002,
'next_plays': {
    'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
    'my_next_play': 'rock'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is reactive and their last play was scissors, it is likely that they will continue to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, your next play should be rock to beat their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```
