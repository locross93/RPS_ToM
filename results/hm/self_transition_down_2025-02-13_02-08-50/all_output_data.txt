Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0 Analysis**:
   - My play: Rock
   - Opponent's play: Rock
   - Result: Tie (0 reward)

Given that there is only one round of data, it's challenging to definitively determine the opponent's strategy. However, we can consider a few possibilities:

- **Static Strategy**: The opponent might be playing a static strategy where they consistently choose rock. This is a common starting point in games like rock-paper-scissors, where players might default to rock due to its perceived strength.

- **Random Strategy**: The opponent could be playing randomly, and it just so happened that they chose rock in the first round.

- **Adaptive Strategy**: It's also possible, though less likely with only one data point, that the opponent is trying to adapt to my strategy. However, since we both played rock, there's no clear adaptation pattern.

Given the current data, the most straightforward hypothesis is that the opponent might be using a static strategy of playing rock. However, this is a tentative hypothesis and will need to be refined as more data becomes available.

In terms of reward, playing rock resulted in a tie, so there's no positive or negative reward trend to exploit yet.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Static or Random (favoring Rock)'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent's strategy seems to be static or random with a favor towards rock, I believe their next play will likely be rock again.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. Result: Tie (0 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors'. Result: Loss (-1 reward).

From these two rounds, we can make some observations:

- In the first round, both players played 'rock', resulting in a tie. This doesn't give much information about the opponent's strategy.
- In the second round, I switched to 'paper', and the opponent played 'scissors', which beats 'paper'. This could suggest that the opponent might be playing a strategy that counters my previous move, but with only two rounds, it's too early to conclude this definitively.

Given the limited data, there are a few possibilities:

- **Random Strategy**: The opponent could be playing randomly, and the results so far are coincidental.
- **Counter Strategy**: The opponent might be trying to counter my previous move, but this is speculative with only two rounds.
- **Static Strategy**: The opponent might have a fixed pattern, but it's not clear what that pattern might be yet.

Since I have received a negative reward when playing 'paper', it suggests that the opponent's play of 'scissors' was effective against my choice. However, this is only one instance, so it's not enough to conclude a static strategy.

For now, the most reasonable hypothesis is that the opponent might be playing randomly or with a simple pattern that isn't clear yet. I will need more rounds to refine this hypothesis.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Undetermined - possibly random or simple pattern'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the previous plays, the opponent has played rock and scissors. There is no clear pattern yet, but they might continue with a different play or repeat one of their previous plays. Assuming a simple pattern or random strategy, they might play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the possibility of the opponent playing rock, my best play would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine my opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. Result: Tie (0 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors'. Result: Loss (-1 reward).
3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper'. Result: Tie (0 reward).

From these observations, let's consider possible strategies:

- **Static Strategy**: The opponent could be playing a static strategy, but it's not clear yet what it might be. They have played 'rock', 'scissors', and 'paper' once each, which doesn't suggest a static pattern.

- **Counter Strategy**: The opponent might be trying to counter my plays. In round 1, they played 'scissors' against my 'paper', which is a counter move. However, in round 2, they played 'paper' against my 'paper', resulting in a tie. This inconsistency suggests they might not be strictly countering my last move.

- **Random Strategy**: The opponent could be playing randomly, as there is no clear pattern yet.

- **Pattern Recognition**: With only three rounds, it's difficult to identify a pattern. However, the opponent might be trying to predict my moves based on previous plays.

Given the limited data, it's challenging to pinpoint the opponent's strategy. However, the fact that I lost when playing 'paper' suggests that the opponent might have some tendency to counter 'paper' with 'scissors'. This could be coincidental, but it's worth considering in future rounds.

**Hypothesis**: The opponent might be playing a semi-random strategy with occasional counter moves. More data is needed to refine this hypothesis.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Semi-random with occasional counter moves'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy is semi-random with occasional counter moves, they might try to counter my last play, which was paper. Since they played scissors after I played paper in round 1, they might repeat this pattern and play scissors again to counter paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter their likely play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

3. **Round 2**: Both played 'paper'. Result: Tie (0 reward).
4. **Round 3**: Both played 'rock'. Result: Tie (0 reward).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- **Round 0 and Round 3**: The opponent played 'rock' both times. This could indicate a preference for 'rock', but it's not conclusive yet.
- **Round 1**: The opponent played 'scissors' when I played 'paper'. This could be a random choice or an attempt to counter 'paper'.
- **Round 2**: The opponent played 'paper' when I played 'paper'. This could suggest a pattern or randomness.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**

- The opponent's plays ('rock', 'scissors', 'paper', 'rock') do not show a clear pattern yet. 
- The opponent might be playing randomly or following a simple pattern that is not yet clear.
- The previous hypothesis suggested the opponent might play 'rock' next, which was correct for Round 3.

**Reward Analysis:**

- Playing 'rock' resulted in a tie twice.
- Playing 'paper' resulted in a loss once and a tie once.

**Conclusion:**

- The opponent's strategy is still undetermined, but there is a slight indication they might favor 'rock'.
- I will continue to monitor their plays to see if a pattern emerges.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Undetermined - possibly random or simple pattern',
    'value': 0.09000000000000002,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the interaction history, the opponent has played 'rock' twice and 'scissors' once, with no clear pattern emerging. However, since the last two plays were 'rock', it is possible they might continue with 'rock' again, especially if they are using a simple or random strategy.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the possibility of the opponent playing 'rock' again, my best move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Semi-random with occasional counter moves', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
2. **Round 1**: I played paper, opponent played scissors, resulting in a loss for me.
3. **Round 2**: Both played paper, resulting in a tie.
4. **Round 3**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
5. **Round 4**: I played paper, opponent played scissors, resulting in a loss for me.

From this history, we can observe the following patterns:

- The opponent has played scissors twice (rounds 1 and 4) when I played paper, resulting in my loss both times.
- The opponent has played rock twice (rounds 0 and 3) when I played rock, resulting in ties.
- The opponent played paper once (round 2), resulting in a tie.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**

1. **Semi-random with Occasional Counter Moves**: The opponent seems to have a tendency to play scissors when I play paper, suggesting a possible counter-move strategy against paper. This aligns with the previous hypothesis of "Semi-random with occasional counter moves."

2. **Static Strategy**: The opponent might be using a static strategy that involves playing scissors more frequently when I play paper, but this is not consistent enough to be purely static.

3. **Pattern Recognition**: The opponent might be recognizing a pattern in my plays and countering paper with scissors.

**Conclusion**: The opponent's strategy seems to involve a semi-random approach with a tendency to counter paper with scissors. This suggests that they might be predicting or reacting to my paper plays with scissors.

**Strategy Moving Forward**: To counter this, I should consider playing rock more frequently, as it beats scissors, which the opponent seems to favor against my paper.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Semi-random with tendency to counter paper with scissors',
    'value': 0.15,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
        'my_next_play': 'rock'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to counter paper with scissors, and the fact that I played paper in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. Result: Tie (0 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors'. Result: Loss (-1 reward).
3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper'. Result: Tie (0 reward).
4. **Round 3**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. Result: Tie (0 reward).
5. **Round 4**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors'. Result: Loss (-1 reward).
6. **Round 5**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. Result: Loss (-1 reward).

From this data, let's hypothesize the opponent's strategy:

- The opponent has played 'rock' twice, 'scissors' twice, and 'paper' twice.
- The opponent's plays do not seem to follow a simple repeating pattern like 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors'.
- The opponent has countered my 'rock' with 'paper' and my 'paper' with 'scissors', which suggests they might be predicting my moves or using a strategy that counters my previous plays.

Given the limited data, one possible hypothesis is that the opponent might be playing a strategy that counters my last move. For example:
- When I played 'rock' in round 0, they played 'rock' (tie).
- When I played 'paper' in round 1, they played 'scissors' (win for them).
- When I played 'rock' in round 3, they played 'rock' (tie).
- When I played 'paper' in round 4, they played 'scissors' (win for them).
- When I played 'rock' in round 5, they played 'paper' (win for them).

This suggests they might be playing a strategy that anticipates my next move based on my previous plays. However, this is still speculative due to the small sample size.

To counter this, I should consider playing a move that counters the move that would counter my last play. For example, if they are predicting I will play 'rock' next, they might play 'paper', so I should play 'scissors'.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Countering my last move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent seems to be countering my last move, and I played rock last, I believe their next play will be paper to counter my rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play paper, I should play scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0:** Both played 'rock', resulting in a tie.
2. **Round 1:** I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors'. I lost.
3. **Round 2:** Both played 'paper', resulting in a tie.
4. **Round 3:** Both played 'rock', resulting in a tie.
5. **Round 4:** I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors'. I lost.
6. **Round 5:** I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost.
7. **Round 6:** I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock'. I lost.

From this data, we can observe the following patterns:

- The opponent has played 'rock' twice, 'paper' twice, and 'scissors' twice. This suggests a possible cycle or random strategy.
- The opponent's plays have resulted in them winning against my 'paper' twice with 'scissors', and winning against my 'rock' with 'paper'.
- There is no clear pattern of them repeating the same move consecutively, which suggests they might not be using a static strategy like always playing 'rock'.

Given the current data, the opponent might be using a strategy that cycles through 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors', or they might be playing randomly. However, the fact that they have countered my moves effectively suggests they might be cycling through the moves in a way that is not immediately obvious.

To test this hypothesis, I should consider playing a counter strategy that assumes they might cycle through 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors'. If they are cycling, I can try to predict the next move based on the previous sequence.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Possible cycling through rock, paper, scissors or random strategy'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's possible cycling through rock, paper, scissors or random strategy, and observing their recent plays, they have played rock twice in a row. If they are cycling, their next play might be paper. However, if they are random, it could be any of the three. Based on the pattern, I will predict their next play to be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent's next play to be paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Both played 'rock', resulting in a tie.
2. **Round 1**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a loss for me.
3. **Round 2**: Both played 'paper', resulting in a tie.
4. **Round 3**: Both played 'rock', resulting in a tie.
5. **Round 4**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors', resulting in a loss for me.
6. **Round 5**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper', resulting in a loss for me.
7. **Round 6**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock', resulting in a loss for me.
8. **Round 7**: Both played 'scissors', resulting in a tie.

From this history, we can observe the following patterns:

- The opponent has played 'rock' twice, 'paper' twice, and 'scissors' three times.
- The opponent's moves do not seem to follow a simple repeating pattern like 'rock-paper-scissors'.
- The opponent has played 'scissors' twice when I played 'paper', resulting in losses for me.
- The opponent has played 'rock' when I played 'scissors', resulting in a loss for me.

Given these observations, the opponent might be using a strategy that favors 'scissors' slightly more than the other options, or they might be reacting to my previous plays in some way. However, the sample size is still small, and the pattern is not entirely clear.

**Hypothesis**: The opponent might be using a strategy that involves playing 'scissors' more frequently, possibly in response to my plays, or they might be using a random strategy with a slight bias towards 'scissors'.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Slight bias towards playing scissors, possibly reacting to my plays'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's slight bias towards playing scissors and the fact that the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, it is likely that the opponent might switch to rock to counter my potential continuation of scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent might play rock, my best counter would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {7: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Possible cycling through rock, paper, scissors or random strategy', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history:

1. Round 0: Both played rock - Tie
2. Round 1: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I lost
3. Round 2: Both played paper - Tie
4. Round 3: Both played rock - Tie
5. Round 4: I played paper, opponent played scissors - I lost
6. Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper - I lost
7. Round 6: I played scissors, opponent played rock - I lost
8. Round 7: Both played scissors - Tie
9. Round 8: Both played paper - Tie

From this data, we can observe the following:

- The opponent has played each of rock, paper, and scissors three times in the first nine rounds.
- The opponent's plays seem to be balanced across the three options, suggesting a possible cycling or random strategy.
- There is no clear pattern of adaptation to my plays, as they have not consistently countered my moves.
- I have not received a positive reward for any specific play, indicating that the opponent's strategy does not favor any particular move of mine.

Given these observations, the opponent might be employing a random strategy or cycling through rock, paper, and scissors without a specific pattern. My previous hypothesis about the opponent possibly cycling through rock, paper, scissors or using a random strategy still holds.

To counter this, I should consider playing a strategy that covers all bases, such as a random strategy myself or trying to predict the next move based on the cycling hypothesis.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Possible cycling through rock, paper, scissors or random strategy'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's possible cycling through rock, paper, scissors or random strategy, and considering their last play was paper, it is likely they might play scissors next if they are cycling.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent might play scissors next, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Both played rock - Tie
2. **Round 1**: I played paper, opponent played scissors - Loss
3. **Round 2**: Both played paper - Tie
4. **Round 3**: Both played rock - Tie
5. **Round 4**: I played paper, opponent played scissors - Loss
6. **Round 5**: I played rock, opponent played paper - Loss
7. **Round 6**: I played scissors, opponent played rock - Loss
8. **Round 7**: Both played scissors - Tie
9. **Round 8**: Both played paper - Tie
10. **Round 9**: Both played rock - Tie

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) three times in the first ten rounds, resulting in a balanced distribution.
- The opponent's plays have resulted in four ties and four losses for me, indicating a potential pattern or reaction to my plays.
- My previous hypothesis suggested a slight bias towards playing scissors, but the recent plays (rock in round 9) don't strongly support this.
- The opponent seems to be playing a strategy that results in ties when I play the same move consecutively (e.g., rock in rounds 0, 3, 9).
- Losses occurred when I switched my play (e.g., paper in rounds 1, 4; rock in round 5; scissors in round 6).

**Hypothesis Refinement:**

- The opponent might be playing a strategy that involves predicting my next move based on my previous plays, aiming to counter my changes.
- The opponent's strategy might not be static but rather reactive, trying to counter my plays when I switch strategies.

**Conclusion:**

The opponent's strategy appears to be reactive, possibly predicting my next move based on my previous plays. They seem to counter my changes effectively, leading to losses when I switch my play. However, when I repeat the same move, it often results in a tie.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy, predicting and countering my changes in play. Tends to tie when I repeat the same move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent tends to tie when I repeat the same move, and I played 'rock' in the last round, it is likely that they will play 'rock' again to tie.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter their 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
2. **Round 1**: I played paper, opponent played scissors, resulting in my loss.
3. **Round 2**: Both played paper, resulting in a tie.
4. **Round 3**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
5. **Round 4**: I played paper, opponent played scissors, resulting in my loss.
6. **Round 5**: I played rock, opponent played paper, resulting in my loss.
7. **Round 6**: I played scissors, opponent played rock, resulting in my loss.
8. **Round 7**: Both played scissors, resulting in a tie.
9. **Round 8**: Both played paper, resulting in a tie.
10. **Round 9**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
11. **Round 10**: I played paper, opponent played scissors, resulting in my loss.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played scissors three times (rounds 1, 4, 10), paper twice (rounds 5, 8), and rock four times (rounds 0, 3, 6, 9).
- The opponent's plays do not seem to follow a simple repeating pattern like "rock-paper-scissors" or any other fixed sequence.
- The opponent has won against my paper with scissors twice and against my rock with paper once.
- The opponent has tied with me on rock three times and on paper once.

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent might be using a strategy that favors scissors slightly more often, as it has appeared three times in the first 11 rounds. However, the distribution is not heavily skewed towards any single choice, suggesting a semi-random or balanced strategy with a slight preference for scissors.

**Conclusion:**

Given the slight preference for scissors, I should consider playing rock more often to counteract this tendency, while still being cautious of the opponent's potential to play paper.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Semi-random with a slight preference for scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy seems to have a slight preference for scissors, and considering they have played scissors in the last round, it is likely they might continue with scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
2. **Round 1**: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost.
3. **Round 2**: Both played paper, resulting in a tie.
4. **Round 3**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
5. **Round 4**: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost.
6. **Round 5**: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost.
7. **Round 6**: I played scissors, opponent played rock, I lost.
8. **Round 7**: Both played scissors, resulting in a tie.
9. **Round 8**: Both played paper, resulting in a tie.
10. **Round 9**: Both played rock, resulting in a tie.
11. **Round 10**: I played paper, opponent played scissors, I lost.
12. **Round 11**: I played rock, opponent played paper, I lost.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has a tendency to play the move that beats my previous move. For example, when I played paper, they played scissors; when I played rock, they played paper.
- There are frequent ties when I repeat the same move (e.g., rounds 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9).
- The opponent seems to predict my next move based on my previous move and counters it.
- My previous hypothesis suggested a reactive strategy, predicting and countering my changes in play, which aligns with the observed pattern.

**Conclusion:**

The opponent likely follows a reactive strategy, predicting my next move based on my last move and countering it. This strategy results in frequent ties when I repeat a move and losses when I switch moves. To counter this, I should play the move that beats the opponent's predicted counter-move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy, predicting and countering my changes in play. Tends to tie when I repeat the same move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent seems to be using a reactive strategy and has countered my last play of rock with paper, it is likely that they will anticipate a change from me. Since I have played rock, paper, and scissors in the past rounds, they might expect me to switch to scissors to counter their paper. Therefore, they might play rock to counter my potential scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play rock to counter my potential switch to scissors, I should play paper to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Rounds 0, 3, 9**: Both players played 'rock', resulting in ties. This suggests that when I play 'rock', the opponent tends to play 'rock' as well.

2. **Rounds 1, 4, 10**: I played 'paper' and the opponent played 'scissors', resulting in losses for me. This indicates that when I play 'paper', the opponent often plays 'scissors'.

3. **Round 2, 8**: Both players played 'paper', resulting in ties. This suggests that when I play 'paper', the opponent sometimes plays 'paper' as well.

4. **Rounds 5, 11**: I played 'rock' and the opponent played 'paper', resulting in losses for me. This indicates that when I play 'rock', the opponent sometimes plays 'paper'.

5. **Round 6**: I played 'scissors' and the opponent played 'rock', resulting in a loss for me. This suggests that when I play 'scissors', the opponent tends to play 'rock'.

6. **Round 7**: Both players played 'scissors', resulting in a tie. This suggests that when I play 'scissors', the opponent sometimes plays 'scissors'.

7. **Round 12**: I played 'paper' and the opponent played 'rock', resulting in a win for me. This is an anomaly compared to previous rounds where playing 'paper' resulted in losses.

From this analysis, it seems the opponent's strategy is somewhat reactive and possibly predictive. They tend to counter my plays, especially when I repeat the same move. However, there are instances where they tie with me, suggesting a possible pattern or cycle in their strategy.

**Hypothesis**: The opponent appears to be using a reactive strategy, predicting and countering my changes in play. They tend to play 'scissors' when I play 'paper', 'paper' when I play 'rock', and 'rock' when I play 'scissors'. However, there are instances of ties, indicating they might also be following a pattern or cycle.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy with predictive elements, countering my plays. Tends to play scissors against paper, paper against rock, and rock against scissors. Occasional ties suggest a pattern or cycle.',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's reactive strategy with predictive elements, they tend to counter my plays. I last played paper, and they have previously played scissors against my paper. Therefore, it is likely that they will play scissors in the next round to counter my paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, I should play rock to counter their scissors and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played scissors against my paper multiple times (rounds 1, 4, and 10), resulting in negative rewards for me.
   - The opponent has played paper against my rock (rounds 5 and 11), resulting in negative rewards for me.
   - The opponent has played rock against my scissors (round 6), resulting in a negative reward for me.
   - There have been ties when I repeated the same move (rounds 0, 3, 7, 8, 9).

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to counter my plays effectively, suggesting a reactive strategy.
   - The opponent tends to play scissors against paper, paper against rock, and rock against scissors.
   - Occasional ties suggest a pattern or cycle, possibly indicating a predictive element or a fixed sequence.

3. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be reactive with predictive elements, countering my plays based on my previous moves.
   - The opponent may be cycling through rock, paper, scissors in a way that counters my most recent plays.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when I played rock against scissors (round 13) and paper against rock (round 12).
   - Negative rewards occurred when the opponent effectively countered my plays.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely using a reactive strategy with predictive elements, countering my plays based on my previous moves. They tend to play scissors against paper, paper against rock, and rock against scissors, with occasional ties suggesting a pattern or cycle.

Based on this analysis, I should continue to exploit the pattern by predicting their next move and countering it effectively.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy with predictive elements, countering my plays. Tends to play scissors against paper, paper against rock, and rock against scissors. Occasional ties suggest a pattern or cycle.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of countering my plays, they tend to play paper against rock. Since my last play was rock, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and my previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played each move (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - There are occasional ties when I repeat the same move, suggesting a reactive element.
   - The opponent seems to counter my plays effectively, especially when I switch strategies.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The opponent is using a reactive strategy with predictive elements, countering my plays.
   - They tend to play scissors against paper, paper against rock, and rock against scissors.
   - Occasional ties suggest a pattern or cycle, indicating they might predict my next move based on my previous plays.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - When I played paper, the opponent often responded with scissors.
   - When I played rock, the opponent often responded with paper.
   - When I played scissors, the opponent often responded with rock.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I received positive rewards when I played scissors against paper.
   - I received negative rewards when I played paper against scissors and rock against paper.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a reactive one, predicting my next move based on my last play and countering it.
   - They might be using a simple counter strategy: play the move that beats my last move.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is that the opponent is using a reactive strategy that predicts my next move based on my previous play and counters it. This strategy involves playing the move that beats my last move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy with predictive elements, countering my plays. Tends to play scissors against paper, paper against rock, and rock against scissors. Occasional ties suggest a pattern or cycle.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of countering my plays, they tend to play rock against scissors. Since I played scissors in the last round, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter their predicted play of rock, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's reactive strategy, they tend to predict and counter my changes in play. I have played 'paper' in the last round and won. Based on their tendency to counter my play, they might switch to 'scissors' to beat my 'paper'.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's reactive strategy and the fact that I have played 'rock' in the last round, they might anticipate that I will continue with 'rock' or switch to 'paper'. Since they tend to counter my changes, they might play 'paper' to counter my potential 'rock' or 'scissors' to counter my potential 'paper'. However, given the recent pattern of my wins with 'rock', they might predict a continuation and play 'paper' to counter it.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent might play 'paper' to counter my 'rock', my best move would be to play 'scissors', which beats 'paper'.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {12: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy, predicting and countering my changes in play. Tends to tie when I repeat the same move.', 'value': 0.34235199000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {12: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy, predicting and countering my changes in play. Tends to tie when I repeat the same move.', 'value': 0.34235199000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and see if there are any patterns:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - The opponent has played each of the three moves (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - There are instances where the opponent's play results in ties, losses, and wins for me.

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - When I played "rock", the opponent played "rock" (rounds 0, 3, 9), "paper" (rounds 5, 11), and "scissors" (rounds 13, 16).
   - When I played "paper", the opponent played "scissors" (rounds 1, 4, 10, 19), "paper" (rounds 2, 8), and "rock" (rounds 12, 15, 18).
   - When I played "scissors", the opponent played "rock" (round 6), "scissors" (round 7), and "paper" (rounds 14, 17).

3. **Hypothesis Development**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to counter my previous move. For instance, when I played "paper" in round 18 and won against "rock", the opponent switched to "scissors" in round 19, which beats "paper".
   - There is a pattern where the opponent tends to play the move that beats my last winning move. This suggests a reactive strategy, where the opponent tries to predict and counter my successful plays.

4. **Refinement of Previous Hypothesis**:
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a reactive strategy, predicting and countering my changes in play. This aligns with the current observations.
   - The opponent does not seem to stick to a single move but rather adapts based on my previous successful plays.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely using a reactive strategy, attempting to counter my last successful move. This means they are not sticking to a static strategy but are instead trying to adapt to my winning plays.

Given this analysis, my strategy should involve anticipating their counter-move and playing the move that beats it.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy, predicting and countering my last successful move. Tends to play the move that beats my previous winning play.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent tends to play the move that beats my previous winning play, and my last winning play was 'paper' (in round 18), I predict that their next play will be 'scissors' to counter my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response:

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent has played each of rock, paper, and scissors multiple times.
   - There are several ties when I repeat the same move, which suggests the opponent might be mirroring or predicting my plays.

2. **Patterns in Opponent's Plays**:
   - The opponent has played paper frequently when I played rock, resulting in losses for me.
   - The opponent has played scissors frequently when I played paper, also resulting in losses.
   - The opponent has played rock when I played scissors, leading to losses as well.

3. **Winning Streak Analysis**:
   - I had a winning streak from rounds 12 to 18, where I played a mix of paper, rock, and scissors.
   - During this streak, the opponent's plays were predictable and countered effectively by my choices.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to be using a reactive strategy, possibly predicting my next move based on my previous plays.
   - The opponent tends to counter my plays effectively when I repeat the same move, indicating a pattern recognition or prediction mechanism.

5. **Static vs. Adaptive Strategy**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be adaptive rather than static, as they have effectively countered repeated plays.
   - However, during my winning streak, the opponent's moves were predictable, suggesting a possible pattern or cycle in their strategy.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely using a reactive strategy that predicts and counters my changes in play. They tend to tie or win when I repeat the same move, indicating a pattern recognition mechanism.

Based on this analysis, I should continue to vary my plays and avoid repeating the same move consecutively to prevent the opponent from predicting my next move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy, predicting and countering my changes in play. Tends to tie or win when I repeat the same move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent tends to counter my repeated plays, and I last played rock, it is likely they will play paper to counter a potential repeat of rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play paper, I should play scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {13: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy with predictive elements, countering my plays. Tends to play scissors against paper, paper against rock, and rock against scissors. Occasional ties suggest a pattern or cycle.', 'value': 0.0007443930000000099, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and look for patterns:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - There are several instances where the opponent's play directly counters my previous play, suggesting a reactive strategy.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - When I played paper, the opponent often responded with scissors (rounds 1, 4, 10, 19).
   - When I played rock, the opponent often responded with paper (rounds 5, 11, 20).
   - When I played scissors, the opponent often responded with rock (rounds 6, 21).

3. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent seems to be using a reactive strategy, where they counter my previous play.
   - This is consistent with the hypothesis from round 13, where the opponent tends to play scissors against paper, paper against rock, and rock against scissors.
   - The recent rounds (19-21) further support this hypothesis, as the opponent consistently countered my plays.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards were achieved when I played paper against rock (rounds 12, 15, 18) and rock against scissors (rounds 13, 16).
   - Negative rewards occurred when my play was countered by the opponent's reactive strategy.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent is likely using a reactive strategy that predicts and counters my previous play.
   - To counter this, I should anticipate their counter and play the move that beats their expected play.

Based on this analysis, my strategy should involve predicting the opponent's next move based on my last play and choosing the counter to their expected move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy countering my previous play. Tends to play scissors against paper, paper against rock, and rock against scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's reactive strategy, they tend to play rock against scissors. Since my last play was scissors, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {12: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy, predicting and countering my changes in play. Tends to tie when I repeat the same move.', 'value': 0.060426732569999975, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent has played each of the three moves (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - There are instances where the opponent's move results in a tie, suggesting they might be predicting my move.

2. **Patterns in Opponent's Play:**
   - The opponent has played scissors more frequently when I played paper (rounds 1, 4, 10, 19, 22).
   - The opponent has played paper when I played rock (rounds 5, 11, 20).
   - The opponent has played rock when I played scissors (rounds 6, 21).

3. **Reactive Strategy Hypothesis:**
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a reactive strategy where the opponent predicts and counters my changes in play.
   - The opponent seems to counter my plays effectively after I switch strategies, indicating they might be adapting to my last move.

4. **Static or Adaptive Strategy:**
   - The opponent's strategy does not appear to be static, as they are not consistently playing the same move.
   - The pattern suggests a reactive/adaptive strategy, where the opponent counters my last move.

5. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards were obtained when I played paper against rock (rounds 12, 15, 18) and rock against scissors (rounds 13, 16).
   - Negative rewards occurred when I repeated the same move, and the opponent countered it effectively.

6. **Refined Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent is likely using a reactive strategy, predicting my next move based on my previous plays and countering it.
   - They tend to counter my repeated moves, suggesting they adapt to my strategy changes.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy, predicting and countering my changes in play. Tends to counter repeated moves effectively.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent tends to counter repeated moves effectively, and I have played 'paper' in the last round, it is likely that they will play 'scissors' to counter my 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play 'scissors', I should play 'rock' to counter their 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Rounds 0-3**: The opponent played rock, scissors, paper, and rock. This sequence doesn't suggest a clear pattern yet.

2. **Rounds 4-6**: The opponent played scissors, paper, and rock. This sequence (scissors, paper, rock) could suggest a cyclic pattern, but it's not consistent with the previous rounds.

3. **Rounds 7-9**: The opponent played scissors, paper, and rock again. This reinforces the potential cyclic pattern of scissors, paper, rock.

4. **Rounds 10-12**: The opponent played scissors, paper, and rock. This is the third occurrence of the sequence scissors, paper, rock.

5. **Rounds 13-15**: The opponent played scissors, paper, and rock. This is the fourth occurrence of the sequence scissors, paper, rock.

6. **Rounds 16-18**: The opponent played scissors, paper, and rock. This is the fifth occurrence of the sequence scissors, paper, rock.

7. **Rounds 19-21**: The opponent played scissors, paper, and rock. This is the sixth occurrence of the sequence scissors, paper, rock.

8. **Rounds 22-23**: The opponent played scissors and paper. This continues the sequence scissors, paper, rock.

From this analysis, it appears the opponent is following a cyclic strategy of playing scissors, paper, rock repeatedly. This pattern has been consistent from round 4 onward.

**Positive and Negative Rewards**:
- Playing rock has resulted in negative rewards when the opponent plays paper.
- Playing paper has resulted in positive rewards when the opponent plays rock.
- Playing scissors has resulted in positive rewards when the opponent plays paper.

Given the cyclic pattern of scissors, paper, rock, I can exploit this by playing the counter to their next expected move. If the pattern continues, the opponent will play rock next, so I should play paper to maximize my reward.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's cyclic strategy of 'cyclic_spr', where they play in the order of scissors, paper, rock, and considering their last play was paper, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of rock, my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 12: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy, predicting and countering my changes in play. Tends to tie when I repeat the same move.', 'value': 0.1196090989593, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent has played each of the three moves (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - There are sequences where I have won multiple rounds in a row, suggesting a pattern in the opponent's play.

2. **Hypotheses from Previous Rounds:**
   - **Round 12 Hypothesis:** The opponent was thought to be using a reactive strategy, predicting and countering my changes in play, with a tendency to tie when I repeat the same move.
   - **Round 24 Hypothesis:** The opponent was thought to be using a cyclic strategy (rock, paper, scissors) with a prediction that they would play rock next.

3. **Analyzing the Interaction History:**
   - From rounds 12 to 18, I won consistently by playing paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, and scissors. This suggests the opponent might have been playing a predictable pattern.
   - The losses in rounds 19 to 23 indicate a possible shift or reset in the opponent's strategy.
   - The win in round 24 with paper against rock supports the cyclic hypothesis, where the opponent might have returned to playing rock.

4. **Current Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent seems to follow a cyclic pattern of rock, paper, scissors, but occasionally resets or shifts their pattern, possibly after a series of losses.
   - The opponent's strategy might involve a simple cycle with occasional deviations, possibly to avoid being too predictable.

5. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing paper against rock, suggesting that predicting the opponent's next move as rock could be beneficial.
   - Negative rewards occurred when the opponent's play deviated from the expected pattern.

**Conclusion:**
Given the evidence, the opponent is likely following a cyclic strategy with occasional deviations. The cyclic pattern hypothesis seems to explain the data well, especially considering the recent win with paper against rock.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation',
    'value': 0.35,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
        'my_next_play': 'paper'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's cyclic strategy of 'scissors-paper-rock' with occasional deviations, and considering the last play was 'rock', it is likely that their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my next play should be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, etc.
   - There seems to be a cyclic pattern in the opponent's plays, often following a sequence like scissors, paper, rock (SPR).
   - The opponent occasionally deviates from this cycle, but the deviations are not frequent enough to suggest a completely random strategy.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - **Cyclic SPR**: The opponent follows a cyclic pattern of scissors, paper, rock with a high probability (0.51).
   - **Reactive Strategy**: The opponent reacts to my plays, often countering them. This hypothesis had a lower probability (0.3837).
   - **Cyclic SPR with Occasional Deviation**: The opponent mostly follows the cyclic pattern but occasionally deviates, which aligns with the observed behavior.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play rock against scissors, paper against rock, and scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards occur when the opponent successfully counters my plays, suggesting they might be predicting my moves or sticking to a cyclic pattern.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - Given the consistent pattern of SPR with occasional deviations, the most likely strategy is a cyclic SPR with occasional deviations.
   - The opponent's deviations might be attempts to counter my plays, but they are not consistent enough to suggest a purely reactive strategy.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely following a cyclic SPR strategy with occasional deviations. This explains the observed pattern and the rewards obtained.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit the cyclic pattern by playing the counter to the predicted next move in the cycle.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy is 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', they seem to follow a cycle of scissors, paper, rock with some deviations. In the last round, they played scissors. Following the cycle, their next play should be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be scissors to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays in the last few rounds have been: paper, scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper.
   - This sequence suggests a cyclic pattern of "paper, scissors, rock" (PSR) with occasional deviations.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - Several hypotheses suggest a cyclic pattern, specifically "cyclic_spr" (scissors, paper, rock) or "cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation".
   - The most recent rounds have shown a strong pattern of the opponent playing "paper" after "scissors", which aligns with the cyclic pattern hypothesis.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards have been obtained when playing "scissors" against "paper", and "rock" against "scissors".
   - Negative rewards occur when playing "paper" against "scissors" and "rock" against "paper".

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - Given the observed pattern and rewards, the opponent is likely following a cyclic strategy with a sequence of "paper, scissors, rock" (PSR) with occasional deviations.
   - The deviations might be attempts to counter my plays, but the overall pattern remains cyclic.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely using a cyclic strategy with a sequence of "paper, scissors, rock" (PSR) and occasional deviations.
   - To counter this, I should continue playing "scissors" when expecting "paper", "rock" when expecting "scissors", and "paper" when expecting "rock".

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_psr_with_occasional_deviation'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy is 'cyclic_psr_with_occasional_deviation', they seem to follow a pattern of playing paper, scissors, rock, and occasionally deviating. In the last round, they played paper, which fits the cycle. Following the cycle, their next play should be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has played each of the three moves (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - There are patterns where the opponent's plays counter my plays effectively, especially when I repeat the same move.
   - Losses occur when I play paper against scissors, rock against paper, and scissors against rock, indicating the opponent is countering my plays.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - **Cyclic Patterns:** Several hypotheses suggest the opponent follows a cyclic pattern (e.g., cyclic_spr, cyclic_psr_with_occasional_deviation).
   - **Reactive Strategy:** Some hypotheses indicate the opponent reacts to my plays, predicting and countering them effectively.
   - **Predictive Elements:** The opponent seems to predict my next move based on my previous plays, especially when I repeat moves.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cyclic pattern with occasional deviations.
   - The opponent tends to counter my plays effectively, especially when I repeat the same move.
   - The opponent's strategy might involve predicting my next move based on my previous plays.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic pattern with predictive elements, countering my plays effectively.
   - The opponent's strategy involves predicting my next move based on my previous plays, especially when I repeat moves.
   - The opponent occasionally deviates from the cycle, possibly to prevent being predictable.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy is a combination of cyclic patterns and reactive elements, predicting and countering my plays effectively.
   - The opponent occasionally deviates from the cycle to maintain unpredictability.

Based on this analysis, I will refine my hypothesis as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_pattern_with_predictive_elements_and_occasional_deviation'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's cyclic pattern with predictive elements and occasional deviation, and considering their recent play of scissors against my paper, it is likely they will continue the cycle. Observing the pattern, they might play rock next as they have shown a tendency to follow a sequence of rock, paper, scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr', 'value': 0.46235100000000007, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - The opponent has played each of rock, paper, and scissors multiple times.
   - There are sequences of ties, losses, and wins, indicating some variability in their strategy.

2. **Previous Hypothesis**: 
   - At round 24, the hypothesis was that the opponent was playing a cyclic strategy: 'cyclic_spr' (scissors, paper, rock).
   - This hypothesis predicted the opponent's next play as 'paper', which was correct for round 29.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - From rounds 0 to 29, the opponent's plays are: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper.
   - This sequence largely follows a cyclic pattern of 'rock, scissors, paper', with a deviation at round 29 where the opponent played 'paper' again instead of 'rock'.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing paper against rock, rock against scissors, and scissors against paper, consistent with the cyclic pattern.
   - Negative rewards occurred when my play was countered by the opponent's play, suggesting the opponent's strategy is predictable and can be exploited.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclic pattern of 'rock, scissors, paper', with a possible deviation or error at round 29.
   - Given the consistency of the pattern, the opponent is likely following a cyclic strategy with a minor deviation.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains that the opponent is playing a cyclic strategy, predominantly 'rock, scissors, paper'.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_rsp',
    'value': 0.8,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy as 'cyclic_rsp' with a high confidence value of 0.8, and considering the last play was 'paper', the opponent is likely following a cyclic pattern of rock, scissors, paper. Given this pattern, their next play should be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my optimal move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr', 'value': 0.6236457000000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 30: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_rsp', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 25: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'value': 0.16835100000000008, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr', 'value': 0.6236457000000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 30: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_rsp', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 25: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'value': 0.16835100000000008, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent's plays in the last few rounds are: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock.
   - This sequence suggests a cyclic pattern of "rock, scissors, paper" (RSP) with some deviations.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - At round 24, the hypothesis was "cyclic_spr" with a high value of 0.6236457000000001, predicting the next opponent play as "rock" and suggesting "paper" as my next play.
   - At round 30, the hypothesis was "cyclic_rsp" with a value of 0.3, again predicting "rock" and suggesting "paper."
   - At round 25, the hypothesis was "cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation" with a value of 0.16835100000000008, also predicting "rock" and suggesting "paper."

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent's plays largely follow a cyclic pattern of RSP, with occasional deviations.
   - My positive rewards are mostly from playing "paper" against "rock," which aligns with the predicted pattern.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent is likely following a "cyclic_rsp" strategy with occasional deviations. The pattern is not perfect, but "paper" seems to be a strong counter-strategy given the frequency of "rock" in the opponent's plays.

5. **Strategy Refinement:**
   - Continue to exploit the cyclic pattern by playing "paper" when "rock" is predicted. Be cautious of deviations and adjust if the pattern changes.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_rsp_with_occasional_deviation'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cyclic_rsp_with_occasional_deviation, and considering the last few rounds, it seems they are following a cycle of rock, scissors, paper with occasional deviations. In the last round, they played rock, which suggests they might follow the cycle and play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr', 'value': 0.8709104751, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the previous guess about the opponent's strategy being cyclic_spr (scissors-paper-rock), and the last action I played was paper, the opponent's likely next play in the cycle is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely next play is rock, my next play should be paper to counter it effectively.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Occasional ties suggest a pattern or cycle.', 'value': 0.03227560396443985, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played scissors against my paper multiple times, resulting in a loss for me (rounds 1, 4, 10, 19, 22, 28, 34).
   - The opponent has played paper against my rock, resulting in a loss for me (rounds 5, 11, 20, 23).
   - The opponent has played rock against my scissors, resulting in a loss for me (rounds 6, 21).
   - There are several ties, indicating some cyclic or repetitive pattern (rounds 0, 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 27, 29).

2. **Hypotheses Evaluation**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve playing scissors against paper, paper against rock, and rock against scissors, which aligns with a reactive strategy.
   - The cyclic patterns observed suggest a possible cyclic strategy with occasional deviations.
   - The hypothesis with the highest value (0.3096) suggests a cyclic pattern of "scissors-paper-rock" (SPR), which aligns with the observed plays.

3. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - Given the consistent losses when playing paper against scissors, rock against paper, and scissors against rock, the opponent seems to be countering my plays effectively.
   - The cyclic SPR pattern with occasional deviations seems to fit the observed data well, as it explains the consistent countering of my plays.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely using a cyclic SPR strategy with occasional deviations, as this hypothesis explains the majority of the observed interactions and losses.

Based on this analysis, I will adopt a strategy to counter the cyclic SPR pattern by playing the move that beats the predicted next play in the cycle.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is following a cyclic strategy of scissors-paper-rock with occasional deviations, and they just played scissors, I believe their next play will likely be paper, following the cycle.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play paper next, I should play scissors to counter it and win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {35: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {35: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a pattern of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with occasional deviations.
   - My rewards have been mixed, with both positive and negative outcomes.

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - There are sequences where the opponent's plays appear to cycle: rock -> paper -> scissors.
   - However, there are deviations from this pattern, suggesting a non-strict cyclic behavior.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play the counter to the opponent's play in the cycle.
   - Negative rewards occur when I fail to predict the deviation or when the opponent's play counters mine.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a "cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation" strategy with a 0.3 probability of deviation.
   - This hypothesis aligns well with the observed data, as there are sequences of cyclic behavior interrupted by deviations.

5. **Strategy Implications**:
   - If the opponent is indeed following a cyclic pattern with occasional deviations, I can exploit this by predicting the next play in the cycle.
   - I should be cautious of deviations and adjust my strategy accordingly.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy is likely a cyclic pattern with occasional deviations. This strategy can be exploited by predicting the cycle and being aware of potential deviations.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation',
    'deviation_probability': 0.3
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cyclic 'spr' (scissors, paper, rock) with occasional deviation, and considering the last play was 'paper' (which I countered with 'scissors'), the next play in the cycle should be 'rock'. However, considering the deviation probability of 0.3, there is a chance they might deviate. Despite this, the most likely play is 'rock' based on the cyclic pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock', my best play would be 'paper', as paper beats rock. This choice also provides a safe option in case of a deviation to 'scissors', as it results in a tie.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cyclic pattern with occasional deviations.
   - The sequence of opponent plays in the last few rounds: rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper,

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Observing the interaction history, the opponent seems to have a pattern where they often switch to playing scissors after losing to paper. Given that I played paper in the last round and won, it is likely that the opponent will play scissors in the next round to counter my paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

                An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 37, {'round': 37, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {35: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 36: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr', 'value': 0.46920560507150993, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 30: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_rsp', 'value': 0.4034499899999999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 31: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_rsp_with_occasional_deviation', 'value': 0.3787437, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {35: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 36: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr', 'value': 0.46920560507150993, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 30: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_rsp', 'value': 0.4034499899999999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 31: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_rsp_with_occasional_deviation', 'value': 0.3787437, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cyclic pattern with occasional deviations. The sequence of plays often follows a pattern of scissors, paper, rock (SPR), which is evident from rounds where I predicted their next play as scissors and won by playing rock.
   - There are instances where the opponent deviates from this pattern, as seen in rounds where I lost or tied.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - The hypotheses suggest a cyclic pattern with occasional deviations, specifically "cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation" and "cyclic_rsp_with_occasional_deviation."
   - The predicted opponent's next play has often been scissors, which aligns with the cyclic SPR pattern.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play rock against their predicted scissors, indicating that the opponent frequently plays scissors in the cycle.
   - Negative rewards occur when the opponent deviates from the expected pattern, suggesting a non-static strategy with some randomness.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent's strategy is likely a cyclic pattern of SPR with a probability of deviation. The deviations are not frequent enough to completely disrupt the cycle, as evidenced by the successful predictions and positive rewards when playing rock.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent is likely following a "cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation" strategy. The deviations are not systematic enough to suggest a different pattern, and the cyclic nature is dominant.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation',
    'deviation_probability': 0.3
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation and the last action I played was rock, the opponent is likely to follow their cycle of scissors -> paper -> rock. Since they played scissors last, their next play in the cycle should be paper. However, considering their deviation probability of 0.3, there is a chance they might deviate from this pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my best move would be scissors. This will ensure a win if they follow their cycle. If they deviate, the choice of scissors still provides a chance to win or tie against a possible deviation to rock or scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {36: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr', 'value': 0.628443923550057, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 37: {'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 38: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 35: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'value': 0.15990000000000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cyclic pattern of "scissors-paper-rock" (SPR) with occasional deviations.
   - There are instances where the opponent deviates from this pattern, but the majority of the plays align with the SPR cycle.
   - The deviations do not appear to be frequent, suggesting a low probability of deviation.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The hypotheses at rounds 24, 36, and 38 suggest a "cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation" strategy with a deviation probability of around 0.3.
   - The hypothesis at round 37, which predicted "scissors" and suggested "rock" as my next play, aligns with the cyclic SPR pattern.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play "scissors" against "paper," "rock" against "scissors," and "paper" against "rock," which aligns with countering the SPR cycle.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play the same move as the opponent or when I fail to counter their move.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy is likely a cyclic SPR pattern with occasional deviations.
   - The deviation probability is approximately 0.3, meaning the opponent occasionally plays a move that does not fit the SPR cycle.
   - The cyclic pattern is predictable, and I can exploit it by playing the counter to the predicted next move in the cycle.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely following a "cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation" strategy.
   - To maximize my rewards, I should continue predicting the next move in the SPR cycle and counter it, while being aware of possible deviations.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation',
    'deviation_probability': 0.3
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation' and the last action I played (scissors), the opponent is likely to follow their cycle of rock-paper-scissors. Since they played paper last, their next play in the cycle should be rock. However, considering their deviation probability of 0.3, there is a chance they might deviate from this pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be paper, as it beats rock. This choice also covers the possibility of them deviating to scissors, as paper would still result in a tie.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.7599, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy as 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation' and the fact that they played 'rock' in the last round, it is likely that they will continue their cycle. The cycle 'spr' suggests that after 'rock', their next play should be 'scissors'. However, considering the deviation probability of 0.3, there is a chance they might deviate. Despite this, the most probable play remains 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my optimal move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {36: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.282351, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {36: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.282351, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine my opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cyclic pattern of "scissors-paper-rock" (SPR) with occasional deviations.
   - My previous hypothesis suggested a deviation probability of 0.3, which means the opponent occasionally deviates from the SPR cycle.

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays in the last few rounds have been: paper (round 41), rock (round 40), rock (round 39), paper (round 38), paper (round 37), scissors (round 36), rock (round 35), scissors (round 34), paper (round 33), rock (round 32), scissors (round 31), paper (round 30).
   - This sequence supports the cyclic SPR pattern with some deviations.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have received positive rewards when playing rock against scissors, paper against rock, and scissors against paper, which aligns with the expected outcomes against a cyclic SPR strategy.
   - Negative rewards occur when the opponent deviates from the expected pattern.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent is likely following a cyclic SPR strategy with a deviation probability of around 0.3.
   - The deviations seem random and do not follow a predictable pattern.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The previous hypothesis still holds well, and the opponent's strategy can be described as a cyclic SPR with occasional deviations.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to use the hypothesis to predict the opponent's next move and choose my counter strategy accordingly.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation',
    'deviation_probability': 0.3
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation' and the last play being 'paper', the likely next play in the cycle is 'rock'. However, considering the deviation probability of 0.3, there is a chance they might deviate. Despite this, the most probable play remains 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {36: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.49764569999999997, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 42: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr', 'value': 0.19678938604436869, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 38: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.11793000000000003, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {36: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.49764569999999997, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 42: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr', 'value': 0.19678938604436869, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 38: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.11793000000000003, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cyclic pattern of scissors-paper-rock (SPR) with occasional deviations.
   - There are instances where the opponent's play deviates from the expected cycle, which suggests a non-deterministic element in their strategy.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The hypotheses consistently suggest a "cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation" strategy with a deviation probability of 0.3.
   - The predicted opponent's next play has often been "rock," and my counter-strategy has been "paper," which has yielded positive rewards.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing "paper" has frequently resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays "rock."
   - This suggests that the opponent's strategy is predictable enough to exploit by playing "paper."

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The consistent success of playing "paper" against the predicted "rock" supports the hypothesis of a cyclic SPR strategy with occasional deviations.
   - The deviation probability of 0.3 aligns with the observed deviations in the opponent's play pattern.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely following a "cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation" strategy, with a deviation probability of 0.3.
   - The strategy involves cycling through scissors, paper, and rock, with occasional deviations that do not follow the cycle.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations and explains the data well.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation',
    'deviation_probability': 0.3
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation, their typical cycle is scissors -> paper -> rock. Since they played rock in the last round, the next play in their cycle should be scissors. However, considering their deviation probability of 0.3, there is a chance they might deviate from this pattern. Despite this, the most likely play is scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {36: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.64835199, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 42: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr', 'value': 0.43775257023105807, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 38: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.382551, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 43: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {36: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.64835199, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 42: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 24: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr', 'value': 0.43775257023105807, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 38: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.382551, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 43: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and the hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cyclic pattern of "scissors-paper-rock" (SPR) with occasional deviations.
   - When I play "rock," I often receive a positive reward, especially when the opponent plays "scissors."
   - The opponent's deviations from the SPR cycle seem to occur with a probability of about 0.3, as suggested by previous hypotheses.

2. **Hypotheses Evaluation**:
   - The consistent prediction of the opponent's next play being "scissors" aligns with the cyclic SPR pattern.
   - The deviation probability of 0.3 indicates that the opponent occasionally deviates from the cycle, which explains some of the rounds where I received a negative reward.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing "rock" has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent follows the predicted cycle and plays "scissors."
   - This suggests that the opponent's strategy is not highly adaptive or reactive to my plays, but rather follows a predetermined pattern with some randomness.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely following a "cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation" strategy, where they predominantly cycle through "scissors-paper-rock" but occasionally deviate from this pattern with a probability of 0.3.
   - This hypothesis has consistently explained the observed data and predicted the opponent's plays accurately.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit the predicted cycle by playing "rock" to counter the expected "scissors" play from the opponent.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation',
    'deviation_probability': 0.3
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's cyclic strategy of 'scissors-paper-rock' with occasional deviation, and considering the last play was 'scissors', the next expected play in the cycle should be 'paper'. However, considering the deviation probability of 0.3, there is a chance they might deviate from this pattern. Despite this, the most likely play remains 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cyclic "scissors-paper-rock" with occasional deviations, and the fact that they played 'paper' in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be 'rock' if they continue the cycle. However, considering the deviation probability of 0.3, there is a chance they might deviate from this pattern. Despite this, the most probable play following their cyclic pattern is 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play from the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.8276924751, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation and the last action I played being paper, the opponent is likely to continue their cycle. The cycle appears to be scissors, paper, rock, with occasional deviations. Since they played rock last, the next in their cycle should be scissors. However, considering the deviation probability of 0.3, there is a chance they might deviate. Despite this, the most likely play is scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

1.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as paper beats rock. This will maximize my chances of winning the next round.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.9408985189593, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's cyclic strategy of "scissors, paper, rock" with occasional deviations, and considering the last play was 'rock', it is likely that their next play will be 'scissors' if they continue the cycle. However, given the deviation probability of 0.3, there is a chance they might deviate from this pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted play of 'scissors', my best move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors. This choice also provides a safe option in case of a deviation, as rock can tie with rock and only loses to paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation', 'deviation_probability': 0.3, 'value': 0.97972819200304, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of 'cyclic_spr_with_occasional_deviation' and the last action I played was 'paper', it is likely that the opponent will continue their cycle. The cycle appears to be 'scissors', 'paper', 'rock', and since they played 'rock' last, their next play in the cycle should be 'scissors'. However, considering the deviation probability of 0.3, there is a chance they might deviate. Despite this, the most probable play is 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'rock', as rock beats scissors. This choice also accounts for the possibility of deviation, as rock is a solid choice against both scissors and any unexpected deviations to paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
