Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, we have only one round of data where I played 'rock' and my opponent played 'scissors'. This resulted in a win for me, giving me a reward of 3. 

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Single Data Point**: With only one round of data, it's difficult to make a definitive conclusion about the opponent's strategy. However, we can start forming initial hypotheses.

2. **Opponent's Play**: The opponent played 'scissors'. This could be a random choice, part of a static strategy, or the beginning of a more complex pattern.

3. **My Reward**: I received a positive reward by playing 'rock', which suggests that 'rock' was a good choice against the opponent's play of 'scissors'.

4. **Initial Hypothesis**: Given the limited data, one hypothesis could be that the opponent is playing a static strategy of always choosing 'scissors'. This is a simplistic assumption but a starting point for further analysis.

5. **Testing the Hypothesis**: In the next rounds, I can continue playing 'rock' to test if the opponent consistently plays 'scissors'. If the opponent changes their play, I will need to adjust my hypothesis.

6. **Strategy Adaptation**: If the opponent is indeed playing a static strategy of 'scissors', I can exploit this by consistently playing 'rock'. However, I need more data to confirm this hypothesis.

Summary of the hypothesis in Python dictionary format:

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Potentially static strategy of playing scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent played scissors in the last round and my initial guess is that they might have a static strategy of playing scissors, I believe their next play will likely be scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play scissors again, I should play rock to counter their move and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's likely policy, let's review the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', and the opponent played 'scissors'. I received a reward of 3, indicating a win.
2. **Round 1**: I played 'rock', and the opponent played 'rock'. I received a reward of 0, indicating a tie.

From these two rounds, we can make some observations:

- In the first round, the opponent played 'scissors', which lost to my 'rock'.
- In the second round, the opponent played 'rock', resulting in a tie.

Given this limited data, it's challenging to definitively determine the opponent's strategy. However, we can hypothesize a few possibilities:

1. **Random Strategy**: The opponent might be playing randomly, as there is no clear pattern in their plays so far.
2. **Adaptive Strategy**: The opponent might have switched to 'rock' in the second round to counter my 'rock', but this is speculative with only two rounds of data.
3. **Static Strategy**: The opponent might have a static strategy that involves playing 'rock' or 'scissors', but again, this is uncertain with limited data.

Since I received a positive reward when playing 'rock' in the first round and a neutral reward in the second round, it's possible that the opponent's strategy might involve playing 'scissors' or 'rock' more frequently. However, more data is needed to confirm this.

For now, the hypothesis is that the opponent might be playing either a random or a static strategy, possibly favoring 'rock' or 'scissors'. I will continue to monitor their plays in future rounds to refine this hypothesis.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Possibly random or static, favoring rock or scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent has played rock twice and scissors once, it seems they might favor rock or have a random strategy. Since they repeated rock in the last round, they might play rock again in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter a potential rock play by the opponent, my best move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To analyze the opponent's likely policy, let's examine the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors'. I won with a reward of 3.
2. **Round 1**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. It was a tie with a reward of 0.
3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper'. It was a tie with a reward of 0.

From this data, we can make the following observations:

- In Round 0, the opponent played 'scissors', which I countered with 'rock' and won.
- In Round 1, the opponent played 'rock', resulting in a tie.
- In Round 2, the opponent played 'paper', resulting in another tie.

The opponent has played each of the three possible moves once: 'scissors', 'rock', and 'paper'. This could suggest a random strategy or a cyclic strategy (e.g., rotating through 'scissors', 'rock', 'paper'). However, with only three rounds, it's difficult to definitively conclude the opponent's strategy.

Given the limited data, a hypothesis could be that the opponent is playing a random strategy or possibly a cyclic strategy. Since I have only encountered each move once, I cannot yet determine a pattern or a static strategy.

To exploit a potential cyclic strategy, I could consider playing the move that beats the next expected move in the cycle. However, with the current data, predicting the next move is uncertain.

**Hypothesis Summary:**

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy, insufficient data to determine a pattern'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy seems random or cyclic and considering the last two plays were ties with 'rock' and 'paper', the opponent might play 'scissors' next to complete a cycle.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors', my next play should be 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

1. Round 0: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.
2. Round 1: I played rock, opponent played rock. It was a tie.
3. Round 2: I played paper, opponent played paper. It was a tie.
4. Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.

From this data, we can observe the following:

- The opponent has played scissors twice and rock and paper once each. This suggests a potential pattern or cycle, but with only four rounds, it's difficult to determine a definitive pattern.
- When I played rock, I received positive rewards twice (rounds 0 and 3) and a tie once (round 1). This suggests that playing rock has been beneficial so far.
- The opponent's plays do not seem to adapt to my strategy, as they repeated scissors after losing to rock in round 0.

Given these observations, the opponent might be using a random or cyclic strategy, potentially favoring scissors. However, the sample size is too small to confirm a specific pattern. Since playing rock has yielded positive results, it may be beneficial to continue playing rock until more data is available to refine the hypothesis.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy, possibly favoring scissors, insufficient data to determine a pattern'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's previous plays, they have played scissors twice, rock once, and paper once. There is a possibility of a cyclic pattern or random strategy. Since they played scissors in the last round and I won, they might switch to rock or paper. However, given the limited data, I will predict they might play rock next as a change from scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy, insufficient data to determine a pattern', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Possibly random or static, favoring rock or scissors', 'value': 0.363, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 4: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy, possibly favoring scissors, insufficient data to determine a pattern', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine my opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors'. I won (+3 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. It was a tie (0 reward).
3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper'. It was a tie (0 reward).
4. **Round 3**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors'. I won (+3 reward).
5. **Round 4**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I won (+3 reward).

From this data, we can observe the following:

- The opponent has played 'rock' twice, 'scissors' twice, and 'paper' once.
- When I played 'rock', I won against 'scissors' twice and tied against 'rock' once.
- When I played 'paper', I tied against 'paper' once and won against 'rock' once.

Given these observations, the opponent's strategy seems to be somewhat random or cyclic, with a slight inclination towards 'rock' and 'scissors'. The opponent has not shown a clear pattern or adaptation to my plays yet.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**

- The opponent might be using a strategy that cycles through 'rock', 'scissors', and 'paper', but with a higher frequency of 'rock' and 'scissors'.
- My previous hypotheses suggested a random or cyclic strategy, which still holds true given the current data.
- I have been successful when playing 'rock' against 'scissors' and 'paper' against 'rock'. This suggests that the opponent might not be adapting to my strategy.

**Conclusion:**

The opponent's strategy appears to be random or cyclic, with a slight favor towards 'rock' and 'scissors'. I should continue to exploit this by playing 'paper', which counters 'rock', and occasionally 'rock', which counters 'scissors'.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy, slight favor towards rock and scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the previous interaction history and the guess that the opponent might be using a random or cyclic strategy with a slight favor towards rock and scissors, it seems likely that the opponent might continue this pattern. Since they played rock in the last round, they might switch to scissors next, following a cyclic pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': If the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy, insufficient data to determine a pattern', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history:

1. Round 0: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won (+3).
2. Round 1: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0).
3. Round 2: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie (0).
4. Round 3: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won (+3).
5. Round 4: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won (+3).
6. Round 5: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost (-1).

From this data, we can observe the following:

- The opponent has played scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper in sequence.
- This sequence suggests a cyclic pattern: scissors -> rock -> paper -> scissors -> rock -> paper.

Given this pattern, it appears the opponent is cycling through the three options in order. If this hypothesis is correct, the opponent's next play should be scissors, following the observed cycle.

Regarding my rewards:
- Playing rock: +3, 0, +3, -1 (positive overall, but mixed results).
- Playing paper: 0, +3 (positive overall).
- Playing scissors: Not yet played.

Based on the cyclic pattern hypothesis, I should play rock next to counter the expected scissors from the opponent.

Summary of the hypothesis:
```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper',
    'value': 0.85,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the cyclic strategy identified as scissors -> rock -> paper, and considering the last play was paper, the opponent is likely to play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy, insufficient data to determine a pattern', 'value': 0.7599, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the interaction history, the opponent has played 'scissors' three times, 'rock' twice, and 'paper' once. The last play was 'scissors', and given the lack of a clear pattern, it seems the opponent might be using a random or cyclic strategy. Since they played 'scissors' last, they might continue with 'scissors' again or switch to another option. However, given the previous prediction and the opponent's tendency to repeat 'scissors', I will predict that they might play 'scissors' again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'scissors' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'rock', as it beats 'scissors'.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy, insufficient data to determine a pattern', 'value': 0.23193000000000008, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Possibly random or static, favoring rock or scissors', 'value': 0.06750900000000004, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won (+3).
2. **Round 1**: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0).
3. **Round 2**: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie (0).
4. **Round 3**: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won (+3).
5. **Round 4**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won (+3).
6. **Round 5**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost (-1).
7. **Round 6**: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won (+3).
8. **Round 7**: I played rock, opponent played rock. Tie (0).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played rock 3 times, scissors 3 times, and paper 2 times.
- When I played rock, I won twice against scissors, tied twice against rock, and lost once against paper.
- When I played paper, I won once against rock and tied once against paper.
- The opponent's plays do not seem to follow a strict pattern, as they have repeated rock and scissors more frequently than paper.

**Hypothesis:**

- The opponent might be using a strategy that favors rock and scissors more than paper. This could be a cyclic strategy or a random strategy with a bias towards rock and scissors.
- Given the positive outcomes when playing rock against scissors and the tie outcomes against rock, it seems beneficial to continue playing rock, as it has yielded a positive reward overall.

**Conclusion:**

The opponent's strategy appears to be either random or cyclic, with a tendency to favor rock and scissors. Continuing to play rock seems advantageous, as it has resulted in positive rewards more frequently.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy with a bias towards rock and scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to play rock and scissors more frequently, and the fact that they just played rock, it is likely that they might switch to scissors next, following a cyclic pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted scissors play by the opponent, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors'. I won (+3 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. It's a tie (0 reward).
3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper'. It's a tie (0 reward).
4. **Round 3**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors'. I won (+3 reward).
5. **Round 4**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I won (+3 reward).
6. **Round 5**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost (-1 reward).
7. **Round 6**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'scissors'. I won (+3 reward).
8. **Round 7**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'rock'. It's a tie (0 reward).
9. **Round 8**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost (-1 reward).

From this history, we can observe the following patterns:

- The opponent's plays in sequence: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper.
- This sequence suggests a cyclic pattern: scissors -> rock -> paper.

The previous hypothesis at round 6 suggested a cyclic strategy of scissors -> rock -> paper, which aligns with the observed plays. This hypothesis accurately predicted the opponent's play in round 8 as 'paper', which indeed occurred.

**Positive/Negative Reward Analysis**:
- Playing 'rock' has resulted in both wins and losses, depending on the opponent's play in the cycle.
- Playing 'paper' resulted in a win when the opponent played 'rock'.

Given the cyclic pattern, the opponent is likely to play 'scissors' next, following their cycle. Therefore, I should play 'rock' to counter 'scissors'.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper',
    'value': 0.237,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
        'my_next_play': 'rock'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the cyclic strategy I previously guessed (scissors -> rock -> paper), and considering the last play was paper, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely next play is scissors, my best counter move should be rock to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and the previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Rounds 0, 3, 6, 9**: Opponent played 'scissors', and I played 'rock', resulting in a win for me.
   - **Rounds 1, 7**: Opponent played 'rock', and I played 'rock', resulting in a tie.
   - **Rounds 2**: Opponent played 'paper', and I played 'paper', resulting in a tie.
   - **Rounds 4**: Opponent played 'rock', and I played 'paper', resulting in a win for me.
   - **Rounds 5, 8**: Opponent played 'paper', and I played 'rock', resulting in a loss for me.

2. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cyclic pattern: 'scissors' -> 'rock' -> 'paper'.
   - This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that the opponent is using a cyclic strategy.

3. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The most consistent hypothesis is that the opponent is using a cyclic strategy: 'scissors' -> 'rock' -> 'paper'.
   - This hypothesis has been supported by the interaction history, especially in rounds 0, 3, 6, and 9 where the opponent played 'scissors'.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing 'rock' has resulted in positive rewards when the opponent plays 'scissors'.
   - Playing 'paper' has resulted in positive rewards when the opponent plays 'rock'.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely using a cyclic strategy: 'scissors' -> 'rock' -> 'paper'.
   - To counter this, I should continue playing 'rock' when expecting 'scissors', 'paper' when expecting 'rock', and 'scissors' when expecting 'paper'.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit the cyclic pattern by predicting the opponent's next move and playing the counter strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the cyclic strategy of the opponent (scissors -> rock -> paper), and considering their last play was scissors, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play rock next, my best counter move should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.62613, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 9: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy with a bias towards rock and scissors', 'value': 0.363, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 4: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy, possibly favoring scissors, insufficient data to determine a pattern', 'value': 0.31700369999999994, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 5: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy, slight favor towards rock and scissors', 'value': 0.281709, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.62613, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 9: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy with a bias towards rock and scissors', 'value': 0.363, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 4: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy, possibly favoring scissors, insufficient data to determine a pattern', 'value': 0.31700369999999994, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 5: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy, slight favor towards rock and scissors', 'value': 0.281709, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has played the following sequence: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock.
   - This sequence suggests a cyclic pattern: scissors -> rock -> paper.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - Multiple hypotheses have suggested a cyclic strategy of scissors -> rock -> paper.
   - The predicted opponent's next play has consistently been 'rock', and my counter strategy has been 'paper', which has resulted in positive rewards.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - When I played 'rock', I received positive rewards when the opponent played 'scissors'.
   - When I played 'paper', I received positive rewards when the opponent played 'rock'.
   - When I played 'rock' against 'paper', I received negative rewards.

4. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent's plays align with a cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper.
   - This pattern has been consistent across the rounds, and my rewards have been positive when countering this cycle.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent is likely following a cyclic strategy of scissors -> rock -> paper.
   - My best counter strategy is to continue predicting the next play in the cycle and play the counter move.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
        'my_next_play': 'paper'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the cyclic strategy I previously identified (scissors -> rock -> paper), and considering the last play was 'rock', I predict that the opponent's next play will be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'scissors'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.738291, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

To determine my opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays so far: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors.
   - This sequence suggests a cyclic pattern: scissors -> rock -> paper, repeating every three rounds, except for the last round where they played scissors again.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - Hypothesis 6 suggests a cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper, which aligns well with the observed pattern in the interaction history.
   - Other hypotheses suggest random or cyclic strategies with biases, but the clear cyclic pattern observed supports Hypothesis 6.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I played rock, I received positive rewards against scissors and ties against rock, but lost against paper.
   - When I played paper, I received positive rewards against rock and ties against paper.
   - When I played scissors, I received positive rewards against paper and ties against scissors.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely following a cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper. This pattern is consistent with the interaction history and aligns with Hypothesis 6.
   - To exploit this, I should play the counter to their expected next move in the cycle.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's cyclic strategy of scissors -> rock -> paper, and considering that their last play was scissors, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of rock, my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays in order: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock.
   - The sequence suggests a cyclic pattern: scissors -> rock -> paper, repeating every three rounds.
   - The most recent play was 'rock', which fits the cyclic pattern.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - Multiple hypotheses suggest a cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper.
   - The predicted next play based on this hypothesis has been 'rock', which aligns with the opponent's actual play in the most recent round.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are consistently obtained when playing 'paper' against the predicted 'rock'.
   - This further supports the hypothesis of a cyclic strategy, as playing 'paper' against 'rock' yields a positive reward.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely following a cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper.
   - This hypothesis explains the data well, as it aligns with the observed sequence and the rewards obtained.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the observed data, and the strategy to counter this is to play the move that beats the predicted next play in the cycle.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the cyclic strategy of the opponent (scissors -> rock -> paper), and their last play being rock, I predict their next play will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's predicted play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.7008251579541621, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.7008251579541621, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the observed cyclic strategy of the opponent (scissors -> rock -> paper), and considering their last play was 'paper', it is likely that their next play will be 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of 'scissors', my optimal move should be 'rock', as rock beats scissors.

                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.

                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.32816812042479426, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy with a bias towards rock and scissors', 'value': 0.1204831533317306, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 4: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or cyclic strategy, possibly favoring scissors, insufficient data to determine a pattern', 'value': 0.019488294147294694, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine my opponent's likely strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played rock 7 times, scissors 8 times, and paper 4 times in the first 27 rounds.
   - There seems to be a pattern where the opponent plays scissors, rock, and paper in a cyclic manner, but with some deviations.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - **Hypothesis 6**: Suggests a cyclic strategy of scissors -> rock -> paper. This hypothesis has a relatively high value, indicating it might be a good fit.
   - **Hypothesis 8**: Indicates a random or cyclic strategy with a bias towards rock and scissors. This hypothesis has a moderate value.
   - **Hypothesis 4**: Suggests a random or cyclic strategy possibly favoring scissors, but with insufficient data to confirm a pattern. This hypothesis has a low value.

3. **Step-by-Step Reasoning**:
   - The opponent's plays do not strictly follow a simple cyclic pattern, but there is a noticeable tendency to play scissors and rock more frequently than paper.
   - The cyclic pattern hypothesis (Hypothesis 6) seems to explain the data well, as it accounts for the frequent occurrence of scissors and rock.
   - The opponent might be using a cyclic strategy with some randomness or noise, which occasionally disrupts the pattern.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has yielded both positive and neutral rewards, indicating that the opponent often plays scissors or rock.
   - Playing paper has consistently given positive rewards when the opponent plays rock, which aligns with the hypothesis of a cyclic pattern.

Based on this analysis, the most likely strategy of the opponent is a cyclic pattern with some randomness, primarily favoring scissors and rock.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy with randomness: scissors -> rock -> paper, favoring scissors and rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's cyclic strategy with randomness, favoring scissors and rock, and the last play being rock, it is likely that their next play will be paper, following the cycle scissors -> rock -> paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely next play is paper, my next play should be scissors to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

To determine my opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and my previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played a mix of scissors, rock, and paper.
   - There are instances where the opponent's play seems to follow a cyclic pattern: scissors -> rock -> paper.
   - The opponent has favored scissors and rock more frequently, as seen in the rounds where I won by playing rock or scissors.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - The most recent hypothesis suggests a "Cyclic strategy with randomness: scissors -> rock -> paper, favoring scissors and rock."
   - This hypothesis has been consistent in predicting the opponent's next play as paper, which aligns with the cyclic pattern observed.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have received positive rewards when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock, indicating the opponent's tendency to play scissors and rock.
   - Negative rewards occurred when I played rock against paper, suggesting the opponent occasionally plays paper, completing the cycle.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The cyclic pattern hypothesis explains the data well, as it accounts for the observed plays and my rewards.
   - The randomness factor might be causing occasional deviations from the strict cycle, but the overall pattern remains consistent.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely following a cyclic strategy with some randomness, primarily cycling through scissors -> rock -> paper, with a slight favor towards scissors and rock.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit this pattern by playing the counter to the predicted next move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy with randomness: scissors -> rock -> paper, favoring scissors and rock',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's cyclic strategy with randomness, they seem to follow the sequence scissors -> rock -> paper, with a tendency to favor scissors and rock. In the last round, they played paper, which suggests that their next move might be scissors, following their cyclic pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter-move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {27: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy with randomness: scissors -> rock -> paper, favoring scissors and rock', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 21: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.4034499899999999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 22: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.3787437, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 9: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.365589966511862, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy with randomness: scissors -> rock -> paper, favoring scissors and rock', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 6: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper', 'value': 0.25080237900814917, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine my opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays in the last few rounds have been: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, etc.
   - This pattern suggests a cyclic strategy of "scissors -> rock -> paper."

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - Several hypotheses have identified a cyclic strategy with some randomness, favoring scissors and rock.
   - The most recent hypothesis (round 28) suggests a cyclic strategy with randomness, favoring scissors and rock.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play "rock," I often receive positive rewards, especially against "scissors."
   - This indicates that the opponent frequently plays "scissors," supporting the hypothesis of a cyclic strategy favoring scissors.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent appears to follow a cyclic strategy with some randomness, primarily favoring scissors and rock.
   - This strategy aligns with the observed pattern and the positive rewards I receive when playing "rock."

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy is likely a cyclic pattern with some randomness, favoring scissors and rock. This strategy can be exploited by playing "rock" more frequently, as it counters both "scissors" and "rock."

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy with randomness: scissors -> rock -> paper, favoring scissors and rock',
    'value': 0.51,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's cyclic strategy with randomness, favoring scissors and rock, and the last play being scissors, it is likely that the opponent will play rock next, following their pattern of scissors -> rock -> paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper to beat rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To determine my opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays in the last few rounds have been: scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock.
   - This sequence suggests a cyclic pattern: scissors -> rock -> paper, with a tendency to favor rock and paper.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - Several hypotheses suggest a cyclic strategy with randomness, specifically: scissors -> rock -> paper, favoring scissors and rock.
   - The predicted opponent's next play has consistently been 'rock', and my counter-strategy has been 'paper', which has yielded positive rewards.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing 'paper' against the predicted 'rock' has consistently given me positive rewards (3 points), indicating that the opponent often plays 'rock' after 'scissors' or 'paper'.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclic pattern with some randomness, primarily favoring 'rock' and 'paper'.
   - The randomness might be causing occasional deviations, but the pattern remains largely consistent.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely following a cyclic strategy with some randomness, favoring 'rock' and 'paper'. This aligns with the previous hypotheses and the observed interaction history.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to play 'paper' as it effectively counters the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy with randomness: scissors -> rock -> paper, favoring rock and paper',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's cyclic strategy with randomness, which follows the pattern scissors -> rock -> paper, and given that they have been favoring rock and paper, I anticipate that their next play will be rock. This is because the last play was rock, and they might continue with this pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To determine my opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent's plays have been: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, etc.
   - This pattern suggests a cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper.
   - The opponent occasionally deviates from this pattern, which might indicate some randomness or adaptation.

2. **Previous Hypotheses:**
   - Several hypotheses suggest a cyclic strategy with some randomness, favoring scissors and rock.
   - The most recent hypothesis (round 27) predicted the opponent would play scissors next, and I should play rock. This prediction was correct for round 28.
   - The opponent's play in round 33 (paper) fits the cyclic pattern, following rock in round 32.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - I have received positive rewards when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play rock against paper.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent seems to follow a cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper, with occasional randomness.
   - The randomness might slightly favor scissors and rock, as suggested by the hypothesis from round 27.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy is likely a cyclic pattern with some randomness, occasionally favoring scissors and rock.
   - I should continue to predict their next move based on this cycle and adjust for potential randomness.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy with randomness: scissors -> rock -> paper, occasionally favoring scissors and rock',
    'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
    'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the observed cyclic strategy with randomness, the opponent has been following a pattern of scissors -> rock -> paper. In the last round, they played paper. According to the pattern, their next play should be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cyclic pattern: scissors -> rock -> paper.
   - There are instances where the opponent favors scissors and rock more frequently, indicating some randomness or bias in their cycle.
   - The opponent's plays have resulted in a mix of wins, losses, and ties for me, but I've generally been successful when playing rock, especially against scissors.

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - Several hypotheses suggest a cyclic strategy with some randomness, particularly favoring scissors and rock.
   - The most recent hypothesis (round 34) suggests a cyclic strategy with randomness, occasionally favoring scissors and rock.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have received positive rewards when playing rock, particularly against scissors.
   - Negative rewards occur when the opponent plays paper against my rock, but these instances are less frequent.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent is likely following a cyclic strategy: scissors -> rock -> paper, with occasional randomness that favors scissors and rock.
   - This pattern aligns with the interaction history and the positive outcomes when playing rock.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be effectively countered by playing rock, as it has consistently yielded positive rewards against their frequent scissors plays.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy with randomness: scissors -> rock -> paper, occasionally favoring scissors and rock',
    'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
    'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the observed cyclic strategy with randomness, the opponent tends to follow the pattern scissors -> rock -> paper, with occasional deviations favoring scissors and rock. In the last round, they played scissors, which fits the pattern. Following the cycle, their next play is likely to be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.

                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cyclic pattern: scissors -> rock -> paper.
   - There are instances where the opponent's play deviates slightly, suggesting some randomness or bias towards certain plays (e.g., favoring scissors and rock).

2. **Previous Hypotheses**:
   - Several hypotheses suggest a cyclic strategy with some randomness, particularly favoring scissors and rock.
   - The most recent hypothesis (round 34) indicated a cyclic strategy with randomness, occasionally favoring scissors and rock.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are consistently obtained when playing paper against the opponent's rock.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing rock against the opponent's paper, indicating the cyclic nature of their strategy.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclic pattern with some randomness, primarily following scissors -> rock -> paper but occasionally favoring scissors and rock.
   - This aligns with the observed data, where playing paper has often resulted in positive rewards, suggesting the opponent frequently plays rock after scissors.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely using a cyclic strategy with some randomness, favoring scissors and rock. This pattern can be exploited by anticipating their next move based on the cycle.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy with randomness: scissors -> rock -> paper, occasionally favoring scissors and rock',
    'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
    'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's cyclic strategy with randomness, where they tend to follow the sequence scissors -> rock -> paper and occasionally favor scissors and rock, I observe that their last play was rock. According to their pattern, the next play should be paper. However, considering their tendency to favor rock and scissors, there is a chance they might play rock again. Given the randomness, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of paper, I should play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy with randomness: scissors -> rock -> paper, favoring scissors and rock', 'value': 0.7659524751, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cyclic strategy with randomness: scissors -> rock -> paper, favoring scissors and rock', 'value': 0.7659524751, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's cyclic strategy with randomness, where they tend to favor scissors and rock, and considering the last few rounds, the opponent played paper after scissors. Given this pattern and the prediction from the previous analysis, it is likely that the opponent will play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```
