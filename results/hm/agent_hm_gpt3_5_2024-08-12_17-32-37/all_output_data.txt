Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent played "paper" and I played "scissors", resulting in a positive reward for me. This suggests that my opponent is not adapting their strategy and may be playing a static policy. Given that they played "paper" and lost, it's likely that they will continue to play the same move in the next round. Therefore, I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy, which in this case would be "rock".

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent's strategy is to always play paper, their likely play in the next round will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors.
```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, my opponent has played "paper" and "scissors" in the first two rounds. In both cases, I played "scissors" and received a reward of 3 in the first round and 0 in the second round. This suggests that my opponent is not consistently playing the same choice, as I received different rewards for the same play.

Therefore, it seems that my opponent's strategy is not static and may be adapting based on my previous plays. I don't have enough information yet to determine a specific pattern or strategy, but it's clear that my opponent is not consistently playing the same choice.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'My opponent's strategy does not seem to be static and may be adapting based on my plays.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent has played scissors twice in a row, it is likely that they may continue with scissors in the next round, assuming they are following a pattern or have a preference for a particular play.
2. 'my_next_play': Considering the opponent's potential continuation with scissors, your next play should be rock to counter their likely play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent has played rock twice in a row, resulting in a tie both times. This suggests that they might be playing a static strategy of always choosing rock. Since I have received a positive reward when playing paper against rock, I can exploit this by playing paper in the next round.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 2: {'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

Given the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not adapting their strategy based on my plays. They have played rock twice and paper once. In all cases, I have received positive rewards when playing paper. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy, always choosing rock. 

Based on this observation, I can hypothesize that my opponent is likely to always play rock. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that I have consistently received positive rewards when playing paper, indicating that paper is a good counter to rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing rock, their likely play in the next round will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, your next play should be paper to counter this.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {1: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.26009999999999994, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is playing a static strategy. They have played paper in the last two rounds, resulting in a tie both times. This suggests that they may be consistently playing paper. As a result, I can exploit this by playing scissors to counter their paper play and consistently gain positive rewards.

Summary Hypothesis:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing paper, it is likely that their next play will also be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper again, you should play scissors to counter their play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 4: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

My opponent has played rock twice and paper once. In the last round, I played scissors and my opponent played rock, resulting in a negative reward for me. This suggests that my opponent is not playing a static strategy, as they have played different moves. However, they have played rock more frequently than other moves, which could indicate a bias towards rock.

Given the current data, I hypothesize that my opponent is biased towards playing rock, but not exclusively. This bias towards rock could be exploited by playing paper more often to counter their likely preference for rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is biased towards playing rock, but not exclusively.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's bias towards playing rock, it is likely that they will continue with rock in the next round, as they have played rock in 3 out of 6 rounds so far.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering the opponent's bias towards rock, the best counterplay would be to choose paper in the next round, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

My opponent has played scissors in the last two rounds and both times resulted in a tie, giving a reward of 0. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing scissors. If this pattern continues, I can exploit this by consistently playing the counter strategy, which is rock.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent has played rock in the last two rounds, resulting in a tie both times. This suggests that they may be playing a static strategy of always choosing rock. Since I am getting a 0 reward when playing the same choice as my opponent, it seems likely that they are following a static strategy. Therefore, I hypothesize that my opponent is always playing rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of always playing rock, their likely play in the next round will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my next play should be paper.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent's likely policy is to play a static strategy, as they have played the same move in consecutive rounds. They have played "paper" in the last three rounds, resulting in a tie each time. This suggests that they may be playing a static strategy, and I am not getting a positive or negative reward when playing the same choice.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent's strategy is to always play paper, their likely play in the next round will be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors.

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing rock and I am consistently receiving negative rewards when playing scissors. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing rock, which I can exploit by playing paper.

                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy. 
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing scissors.'
                }
                ```
                
                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.
                
            


            An interaction with the other player has occurred at round 12, {'round': 11, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}.
            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 6, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 7, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 9, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 10, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 11, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}].
            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent does not have a clear pattern in their plays.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0. 
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}, 7: {'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent is always playing paper.', 'value': 0.06206999999999996, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

My opponent has played paper in the last two rounds, resulting in a tie both times. Looking at the overall history, my opponent has played paper four times out of the last six rounds. This suggests that my opponent may have a bias towards playing paper. However, this is not a strong enough pattern to conclude that my opponent is always playing paper. 

Given the lack of a strong pattern and the fact that my opponent's plays have not resulted in consistent positive or negative rewards for me, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific strategy that my opponent is using. It seems that my opponent's plays may not be following a simple static policy, and there is no clear pattern to exploit at this point.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'I think my opponent does not have a clear pattern in their plays.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the lack of a clear pattern in the opponent's plays, it's difficult to predict their next move. However, since they played 'paper' in the last round and their strategy is not clear, it's reasonable to assume that they might continue with 'paper' or switch to 'rock' or 'scissors' with equal probability.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering the uncertainty in the opponent's strategy, it's best to play 'rock' in the next round. This choice provides a balanced approach and covers potential outcomes against the opponent's possible plays.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```
