Response:

My opponent played "rock" in the first round, resulting in a tie. Since the outcome was a tie, I don't have any information about whether they are playing a static strategy or adapting to my choices. I will need more rounds to determine their likely policy. 

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'unknown'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent played rock in the last round and their strategy is unknown, it is difficult to predict their next play. However, assuming they might continue with the same play, they might choose rock again.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering the possibility of the opponent choosing rock again, my next play should be paper to counter their choice.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent played 'rock' in the first round and I played 'paper', resulting in a positive reward for me. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy, as they are consistently choosing 'rock'. 

Given this, my opponent's likely policy is to always play 'rock'. This static strategy can be exploited by consistently playing 'paper' to counter their choice.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'static',
'value': 1.0,
'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's static strategy and the fact that they played rock in the last round, it is likely that they will continue to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock in the next round, you should play paper to counter their choice.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Given the interaction history, it seems that the opponent's policy is not based on countering my specific plays. The opponent's plays of "rock" and "paper" in the first two rounds indicate that they might be following a static strategy or a random choice. 

Since the opponent has played "rock" and "paper" with no apparent pattern, it's difficult to discern a specific strategy at this point. The opponent's plays have resulted in a tie and a win for me, so there is no clear indication of a positive or negative reward for them based on their choices.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the opponent may be playing a static strategy or making random choices without adapting to my plays.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Static or Random'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is static or random, their next play is unpredictable. However, based on the previous plays, there is a possibility that they might choose rock or scissors to break the pattern of playing paper twice in a row.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering the unpredictability of the opponent's strategy, it would be best to play rock in the next round as it has not been played in the last two rounds, and it can counter both scissors and potentially the opponent's next play if they choose rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent's strategy is not easily predictable. However, based on the observed plays, it appears that they might be playing a static strategy. They have played paper twice in a row, which suggests a potential static pattern. Additionally, I have received negative rewards when playing rock, indicating that the opponent's strategy might be countering my choices.

Therefore, I hypothesize that the opponent is playing a static strategy of always playing paper. This would explain their consistent plays and the negative rewards I've received when playing rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'static',
'value': 0.237,
'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's static strategy and the fact that they played paper in the last round, it is likely that they will continue to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of paper in the next round, you should play scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing rock. This suggests a static strategy rather than an adaptive one. Given that I am consistently receiving negative rewards when playing the same choice as my opponent, it is likely that they are playing a static strategy and I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's previous plays and the fact that they have won the last two rounds, it seems likely that they will stick with their current strategy and play rock again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock, you should play paper to counter their move.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not playing a static strategy, as their plays have varied. However, I have received negative rewards when playing paper twice in a row. This suggests that my opponent may be exploiting a pattern in my plays. They might be playing a strategy that counters my previous move.

Hypothesis:
My opponent's likely policy is to play the move that beats my previous move. For example, if I play paper, they play scissors to beat it. This would explain the negative rewards I received when playing paper twice in a row.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Counter_previous_move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is "Counter_previous_move" and considering the opponent's play of "scissors" in the last round, they are likely to play "rock" in the next round to counter your previous play of "paper".

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of "rock", your next play should be "paper".

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Given the interaction history, it seems that my opponent's plays are not following a predictable pattern. They have played rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, and paper in the previous rounds, resulting in a mix of positive, negative, and zero rewards for me. This indicates that my opponent is not consistently playing the same choice to give me a positive or negative reward.

Based on the observed plays and rewards, it is difficult to discern a clear pattern or static strategy that my opponent is following. It appears that they may be playing randomly or using a strategy that is not easily discernible from the limited data available.

Therefore, my hypothesis is that my opponent's strategy is not easily predictable and may involve some level of randomness or complexity that is not immediately apparent from the observed plays.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Complex or Random'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of being complex or random, it's difficult to predict their next play based on the previous interactions. However, considering that they have played paper twice in a row, there might be a tendency to switch to a different play to avoid predictability.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering the potential tendency of the opponent to switch their play, it might be strategic to choose scissors in the next round, as it can counter both rock and paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent has played scissors twice in a row, resulting in a tie both times. This suggests that they may be following a static strategy, as they have not adapted their play based on my choices. Since I am getting a neutral reward when playing the same choice as my opponent, it seems like they may be playing a static strategy. 

Based on this observation, my hypothesis is that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing the same option. This means that they are not adapting to my choices and are likely to continue playing scissors in the next round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'static_scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is static and they have been playing scissors consistently, it is likely that they will continue to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, you should play rock to counter their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

My opponent has played scissors twice in a row, and I have received positive rewards both times when playing rock. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing scissors. Given this pattern, I can exploit this by consistently playing rock to maximize my rewards.

```python
{

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not consistently playing the same choice. There is no clear pattern of positive or negative rewards associated with a specific play. This suggests that my opponent may not be following a static strategy, but rather making random choices or using a more complex strategy.

Given the lack of a clear pattern in the rewards, it is difficult to pinpoint a specific strategy that my opponent is using. It's possible that they are using a randomized strategy or adapting based on my previous plays.

As of now, I don't have enough information to form a specific hypothesis about my opponent's strategy. I will continue to observe the interaction history and look for patterns that may emerge.

```python
{
  'Opponent_strategy': 'Unclear'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent has played rock in the last round and their strategy is unclear, it's difficult to predict their next play. However, based on the assumption that their strategy is not adaptive, they might continue with rock.
2. 'my_next_play': Considering the opponent's potential play, my next play should be paper to counter their potential rock play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is not adapting their strategy based on my plays. They have played rock multiple times and have also played paper and scissors. However, they have consistently lost when I played paper, indicating that they may have a static strategy. 

Given that they consistently lose when I play paper, it is likely that my opponent is playing a static strategy where they always play rock. This would explain their consistent losses when I play paper.

Therefore, my hypothesis about my opponent's strategy is that they are playing a static strategy where they always play rock.

```python

```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's static strategy and the fact that they have played rock in the last round, it is likely that they will continue to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock in the next round, your next play should be scissors to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent's likely policy is to play in a way that results in negative rewards for me. Specifically, in the last few rounds, I have received positive rewards when playing rock and scissors, but negative rewards when playing paper. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy where they consistently play the counter to my previous move.

Hypothesis:
My opponent's strategy is to consistently play the counter to my previous move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'counter_previous_move'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is "counter_previous_move" and they played "paper" in the last round, it is likely that they will play "scissors" in the next round to counter your "scissors" play.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of "scissors," you should play "rock" in the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {12: {'Opponent_strategy': 'counter_previous_move', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent's likely policy is to counter my previous move. In the last interaction, I played "rock" and received a positive reward. Looking at the history, I notice that whenever I play "rock," I consistently receive positive rewards. This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy and I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

Summary Hypothesis:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'counter_previous_move',
'value': 0.3,
'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of "counter_previous_move" and the fact that you played rock in the last round, their likely play in the next round is scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, your next play should be rock to beat their likely play.

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent's strategy is not clear yet. They have played rock, paper, and scissors in a seemingly random manner, resulting in a mix of positive, negative, and zero rewards for me. 

In the last round, both the opponent and I played rock, resulting in a tie. Given this, it's difficult to discern a clear pattern in the opponent's strategy. 

At this point, it's hard to determine a specific strategy for the opponent. They may be playing a random strategy or a strategy that is not easily discernible from the limited interaction history.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Unclear'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent has played rock in the last round and their strategy is unclear, it's difficult to predict their next play. However, if we assume they might continue with the same play, they could choose rock again.

2. 'my_next_play': Considering the potential continuation of the opponent's play, my next play should be paper to counter their potential rock play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Unclear', 'value': 0.33213, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 14: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Unclear', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 1: {'Opponent_strategy': 'unknown', 'value': 0.2998441883013, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent is not adapting their strategy and may be playing a static policy. They have consistently played rock in the last few rounds, and I have been consistently getting positive rewards when playing paper. This suggests that the opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing rock.

Hypothesis:
The opponent's strategy is to always play rock.

Summary:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Always rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of "Always rock" and the fact that you played paper in the last round, it is likely that the opponent will continue to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock in the next round, your next play should be scissors to counter their rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent is consistently playing "rock" and I have been getting negative rewards when playing "scissors" against their "rock" play. This suggests that my opponent may be following a static strategy of always playing "rock". 

Given the consistent pattern of my opponent's plays and the negative rewards I've been receiving, it is likely that my opponent's strategy is to always play "rock". This static strategy can be exploited by consistently playing the counter strategy, which in this case would be "paper".

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Always rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of "Always rock" and the fact that they have consistently played rock in the past, it is likely that they will continue to play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock, you should play paper in the next round to counter their rock play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Unclear', 'value': 0.07274370000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 14: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Unclear', 'value': 0.05700000000000005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}, 1: {'Opponent_strategy': 'unknown', 'value': 0.05692365226763696, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent is not playing a static strategy. The previous hypotheses have not provided a clear explanation for the opponent's behavior. However, it's evident that the opponent is adapting their strategy based on my previous plays.

The opponent's likely policy seems to be countering my previous play. For instance, when I played rock, they played paper, and when I played paper, they played scissors. This indicates that they may be trying to exploit my previous choices.

I am getting negative rewards when playing the same choice as the opponent. This suggests that the opponent may be playing a dynamic strategy to counter my moves.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Dynamic counter strategy'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's dynamic counter strategy, it is likely that they will play rock in the next round to counter your paper play.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, you should play scissors in the next round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent's likely policy is to play the choice that loses to my previous play. Here's the step by step reasoning:

1. In round 1, I played rock and got a reward of 0. This means that my opponent played rock as well, resulting in a tie.
2. In round 2, I played paper and got a reward of 3. This indicates that my opponent played rock, which loses to paper.
3. In round 3, I played paper again and got a reward of 0. This suggests that my opponent also played paper, resulting in a tie.
4. In round 4, I played rock and received a reward of -1. This implies that my opponent played paper, which beats rock.
5. In round 5, I played scissors and received a reward of -1. This indicates that my opponent played rock, which beats scissors.
6. In round 6, I played paper and got a reward of 0. This suggests that my opponent also played paper, resulting in a tie.
7. In round 8, I played rock and received a reward of 3. This implies that my opponent played scissors, which loses to rock.
8. In round 10, I played paper and got a reward of 3. This indicates that my opponent played rock, which loses to paper.
9. In round 11, I played scissors and received a reward of 3. This implies that my opponent played paper, which loses to scissors.
10. In round 12, I played rock and received a reward of 3. This indicates that my opponent played scissors, which loses to rock.
11. In round 14, I played paper and got a reward of 3. This suggests that my opponent played rock, which loses to paper.
12. In round 15, I played scissors and received a reward of -1. This implies that my opponent played rock, which beats scissors.
13. In round 16, I played paper and received a reward of -1. This indicates that my opponent played scissors, which beats paper.
14. In round 17, I played scissors and received a reward of 3. This implies that my opponent played paper, which loses to scissors.

Based on this analysis, it seems that my opponent's likely policy is to play the choice that loses to my previous play. Therefore, my hypothesis is that my opponent is playing a static strategy of always choosing the losing option.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Always choose the option that loses to my previous play'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of "Always choose the option that loses to my previous play", and considering that you played scissors in the last round, the opponent's likely play in the next round is paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, your next play should be rock to counter their likely play of paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent's likely policy seems to be playing a static strategy, as there is no clear pattern or adaptation in their plays. Looking at the interaction history, I can see that they played "scissors" twice and "rock" four times. When I played "rock," I received positive rewards, indicating that my opponent may not have a strong counter strategy. Therefore, I hypothesize that my opponent is playing a static strategy of favoring "rock" and "scissors" over "paper."

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Static strategy favoring rock and scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy favors rock and scissors, and considering their previous plays, it is likely that they will play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, my next play should be paper to counter their rock play.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent played "scissors" and I played "paper", resulting in a reward of -1 for me. Looking at the interaction history, I notice that my opponent has played "scissors" multiple times and has received positive rewards when I played "paper" or "rock". This suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy where they consistently play "scissors" and counter my choices effectively.

Hypothesis:
My opponent's likely strategy is to consistently play "scissors" in response to my plays of "paper" or "rock" in order to gain positive rewards.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Consistently play scissors in response to paper or rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's consistent strategy of playing scissors in response to paper or rock, it is likely that their next play will be rock, as they may anticipate a change in your strategy.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of rock, your next play should be paper to counter their anticipated change in strategy.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent has played "paper" in the last two rounds, resulting in a tie both times. This suggests that they may be following a static strategy, as they are consistently playing the same move regardless of my previous plays. Since I am getting a neutral reward when playing the same choice as my opponent, it indicates that they might be following a static strategy. Therefore, I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy to their consistent move.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Static'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is static and they have been playing paper consistently, it is likely that they will continue to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, my next play should be scissors to beat their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {21: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Static', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

My opponent's likely policy seems to be static, as they have consistently played the same move in the last few rounds. Specifically, they have played paper in the last two rounds. Additionally, I have been getting positive rewards when playing scissors, which suggests that my opponent may be playing a static strategy and I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy, which in this case would be rock.

Summary Hypothesis:
```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Static',
'value': 0.3,
'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's previous plays and the fact that they have a static strategy with a 0.3 win rate, it is likely that their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, your next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

My opponent has played "scissors" for the last two rounds, resulting in a tie both times. This suggests that they may be following a static strategy, as they are consistently playing the same move regardless of my previous plays. Since I am getting a 0 reward when playing the same choice as my opponent, it seems like they are not adapting their strategy based on my moves.

Based on this observation, my hypothesis is that my opponent is playing a static strategy where they choose their moves randomly or in a fixed pattern without considering my previous plays.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Static or Random'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is static or random, their next play is unpredictable. However, based on the history, they might continue with a random play.
2. 'my_next_play': Since the opponent's play is unpredictable, it's best to continue with a random play as well to maintain a balanced strategy.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {21: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Static', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent's strategy is not static, as their plays have varied. However, they have consistently beaten my plays with scissors, resulting in negative rewards. This suggests that the opponent may be favoring the scissors play. 

Given this, my hypothesis is that the opponent's likely policy is to favor the scissors play more often than rock or paper. This could be due to a bias or a deliberate strategy to exploit my previous plays.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Biased towards scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's bias towards scissors and the fact that they won the last round with scissors, it is likely that they will continue to favor scissors in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Considering the opponent's likely play, you should choose rock in the next round to counter their scissors play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent's likely policy is to play a counter strategy. They have consistently played the choice that beats my previous play, resulting in negative rewards for me. This suggests that they may be using a simple static strategy to counter my moves.

Hypothesis:
My opponent's strategy is to play the choice that beats my previous play.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Counter'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is "Counter" and they played "paper" in the last round, they are likely to play "scissors" in the next round to counter your "rock" play.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of "scissors," your next play should be "rock" to beat their "scissors."

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response:

My opponent has played rock consistently for the last three rounds, resulting in a tie each time. This suggests that they may be following a static strategy of always playing rock. As a result, I have been getting a neutral reward when playing the same choice. Therefore, my opponent's likely policy is to always play rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Always play rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent's strategy is "Always play rock" and the last action I played was rock, I predict that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play rock, I should play paper in the next round to counter their play.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {21: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Static', 'value': 0.02429099999999995, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent is playing a static strategy. In the last interaction, both the opponent and I played "paper" resulting in a tie, and the opponent has consistently played "paper" in the past few rounds. This indicates that the opponent may be following a static strategy of always playing "paper."

Given this observation, I can exploit this by playing the counter strategy, which in this case would be "scissors." By consistently playing "scissors," I can expect to gain positive rewards as the opponent continues to play "paper."

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Static',
'value': 0.02429099999999995,
'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the history of the opponent's plays and the fact that they have been playing statically, it is likely that their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent is playing a static strategy. They have consistently played "paper" in the last few rounds, and I have been consistently getting positive rewards when playing "scissors" against their "paper." This suggests that the opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing "paper."

Therefore, my hypothesis is that the opponent is playing a static strategy of always choosing "paper."

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Static',
'value': 1.0,  # indicating a high confidence in the hypothesis
'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's static strategy and the fact that they played paper in the last round, it is likely that they will continue to play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of paper in the next round, you should play scissors to counter their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that my opponent's strategy is not based on countering my specific plays. The fact that we tied when both playing scissors suggests that they may not be favoring any specific play to gain a positive reward. This indicates that they might be playing a static strategy, where their choice is not influenced by my previous plays.

Therefore, my hypothesis is that my opponent is playing a static strategy, where their choice of play is not influenced by my previous plays.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'static'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy is static and they have played scissors in the last round, it is likely that they will continue to play scissors in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of scissors in the next round, my next play should be rock to beat their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history. 
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between. 
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm. 
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice? 
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock. 
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy. 
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {29: {'Opponent_strategy': 'static', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}, 28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Static', 'value': 0.09000000000000002, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

Based on the interaction history, it seems that the opponent is playing a static strategy. They have consistently played "scissors" in the last few rounds, and I have consistently received positive rewards when playing "rock" against their "scissors." This suggests that the opponent may be playing a static strategy of always choosing "scissors."

Hypothesis:
The opponent is likely playing a static strategy of always choosing "scissors" regardless of my previous plays.

I will use this hypothesis to inform my strategy in the next round.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'static',
'value': 1.0,
'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's static strategy and the fact that they played scissors in the last round, it is likely that they will continue to play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play of scissors in the next round, my next play should be rock to beat their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
