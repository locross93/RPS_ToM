Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0 Analysis**:
   - I played: Rock
   - Opponent played: Paper
   - Outcome: I lost (reward: -1)

From this single round, it's difficult to determine a clear strategy from the opponent. However, we can consider a few possibilities:

- **Static Strategy**: The opponent might be playing a static strategy where they always choose paper. This would explain the outcome of the first round, but with only one data point, this is speculative.

- **Random Strategy**: The opponent could be playing randomly, and paper was chosen by chance in this round.

- **Adaptive Strategy**: The opponent might be trying to counter my previous play. However, since this is the first round, they wouldn't have any prior data to adapt from.

Given that I received a negative reward when playing rock, it suggests that playing rock might not be a safe choice if the opponent continues to play paper. However, with only one round of data, it's too early to make a definitive conclusion about their strategy.

For now, the most straightforward hypothesis is that the opponent might be playing paper consistently, but this needs further rounds to confirm.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Possibly static paper, but more data needed'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent played paper in the first round and my initial guess is that they might be using a static paper strategy, I believe their next play will likely be paper again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play paper again, my best counter move would be scissors to beat their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', and the opponent played 'paper'. I received a reward of -1, indicating a loss. This suggests that the opponent's choice of 'paper' was effective against my 'rock'.

2. **Round 1**: I played 'scissors', and the opponent played 'scissors'. I received a reward of 0, indicating a tie. This suggests that the opponent's choice of 'scissors' was not influenced by my previous choice of 'rock'.

From these two rounds, we can consider a few possibilities:

- **Static Strategy**: The opponent might be playing a static strategy, such as always playing 'paper' or 'scissors'. However, since they played different moves in the first two rounds, this is less likely.

- **Random Strategy**: The opponent could be playing randomly, which would explain the different moves in the first two rounds.

- **Pattern or Cycle**: The opponent might be following a pattern or cycle, such as 'paper' followed by 'scissors'. However, with only two rounds, it's difficult to determine a specific pattern.

- **Counter Strategy**: The opponent might be trying to counter my moves, but with only two rounds, there's insufficient evidence to support this.

Given the limited data, the most straightforward hypothesis is that the opponent might be playing randomly or following a simple pattern. As more rounds are played, this hypothesis can be refined.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern (insufficient data for a clear pattern)'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy appears random or follows a simple pattern, and considering the last two plays were 'paper' and 'scissors', the opponent might choose 'rock' next to complete the cycle or continue with a random choice. However, without a clear pattern, predicting 'rock' is a reasonable assumption.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent might play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern (insufficient data for a clear pattern)', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost (-1 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. It was a tie (0 reward).
3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I won (+3 reward).

From this data, we can make the following observations:

- The opponent has played each option ('rock', 'paper', 'scissors') once in the first three rounds. This could suggest a random strategy or a simple pattern.
- My previous hypothesis suggested that the opponent might play 'rock' next, which was correct for round 2. This could indicate a pattern where the opponent cycles through 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors' in order, but there is insufficient data to confirm this yet.

Given that I received a positive reward when playing 'paper' in round 2, it might be beneficial to continue playing 'paper' if the opponent is likely to play 'rock' again. However, since the opponent has played each option once, they might be cycling through them or playing randomly.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**
- The opponent might be playing a simple pattern, possibly cycling through 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors'. However, with only three rounds of data, this is not definitive.
- Alternatively, the opponent could be playing randomly, as each option has been played once.

**Conclusion:**
- Continue monitoring the opponent's plays to determine if a pattern emerges.
- For now, playing 'paper' could be a safe choice if the opponent repeats 'rock'.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern (insufficient data for a clear pattern)',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
        'my_next_play': 'paper'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the interaction history, the opponent has played 'paper', 'scissors', and 'rock' in sequence. This suggests a possible pattern of cycling through the options. If this pattern continues, their next play might be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern (insufficient data for a clear pattern)', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I received a reward of -1. This suggests the opponent countered my 'rock' with 'paper'.

2. **Round 1**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. I received a reward of 0. This indicates a tie, so no clear advantage or pattern from the opponent.

3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I received a reward of 3. This suggests the opponent played 'rock', which I countered successfully with 'paper'.

4. **Round 3**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper'. I received a reward of 3. This suggests the opponent played 'paper', which I countered successfully with 'scissors'.

From this analysis, the opponent's plays have been: 'paper', 'scissors', 'rock', 'paper'. This sequence doesn't immediately suggest a clear pattern like a cyclic strategy (e.g., rock-paper-scissors) or a static strategy. However, the opponent has played 'paper' twice in four rounds, which might indicate a preference or a simple pattern.

Given the previous hypothesis that the opponent might be playing randomly or following a simple pattern, and the fact that I received positive rewards when playing 'scissors' against 'paper', it seems beneficial to continue playing 'scissors' until a clearer pattern emerges.

In summary, the opponent's strategy could still be random or a simple pattern, with a slight inclination towards playing 'paper'. Therefore, playing 'scissors' might continue to yield positive results.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern with a slight inclination towards paper',
    'value': 0.51,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
        'my_next_play': 'scissors'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the interaction history, the opponent has shown a slight inclination towards playing paper, having played it twice in the last four rounds. Given this pattern and the fact that I last played scissors, which beats paper, the opponent might anticipate this and switch to rock to counter my scissors. However, considering their slight inclination towards paper, they might continue with paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, I should play scissors again. If they switch to rock, I will lose this round, but given their pattern, playing scissors is a reasonable strategy to maximize my chances of winning.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern (insufficient data for a clear pattern)', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost (-1 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. It's a tie (0 reward).
3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I won (+3 reward).
4. **Round 3**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper'. I won (+3 reward).
5. **Round 4**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. It's a tie (0 reward).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played 'paper', 'scissors', 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors' in sequence.
- There is no clear pattern yet, but we can observe:
  - The opponent has repeated 'scissors' twice (rounds 1 and 4).
  - The opponent has repeated 'paper' twice (rounds 0 and 3).
  - The opponent has played each option at least once in the first five rounds.

**Hypothesis:**

- The opponent might be playing a random strategy or a simple pattern that is not yet clear due to insufficient data.
- The opponent's plays do not seem to be directly countering my previous plays, suggesting a lack of adaptation.
- I have received positive rewards when playing 'paper' and 'scissors', but not consistently enough to determine a static strategy from the opponent.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited data, the opponent's strategy could still be random or a simple pattern. I will continue to monitor for any emerging patterns or repetitions in their plays.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern (insufficient data for a clear pattern)',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
        'my_next_play': 'scissors'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the interaction history, the opponent has played scissors twice in a row. Given the previous prediction that the opponent might play paper, and considering the possibility of a random or simple pattern, the opponent might switch to rock to counter my last play of scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': If the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {5: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern (insufficient data for a clear pattern)', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0:** I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost (-1 reward).
2. **Round 1:** I played scissors, opponent played scissors. It was a tie (0 reward).
3. **Round 2:** I played paper, opponent played rock. I won (3 reward).
4. **Round 3:** I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won (3 reward).
5. **Round 4:** I played scissors, opponent played scissors. It was a tie (0 reward).
6. **Round 5:** I played paper, opponent played rock. I won (3 reward).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played rock twice (rounds 2 and 5), paper twice (rounds 0 and 3), and scissors twice (rounds 1 and 4).
- There is no clear pattern in the opponent's plays that suggests a static strategy like always playing the same move.
- However, the opponent has played rock after playing scissors in rounds 1 and 4, which might suggest a tendency to play rock after scissors.
- My wins have occurred when I played paper against the opponent's rock (rounds 2 and 5) and scissors against the opponent's paper (round 3).
- The opponent's plays seem to be somewhat balanced across rock, paper, and scissors, which might indicate a random or simple pattern strategy.

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent might be playing a strategy that involves a random or simple pattern, with a slight tendency to play rock after scissors. This hypothesis is based on the limited data available and may need further refinement as more rounds are played.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern with a tendency to play rock after scissors',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
        'my_next_play': 'paper'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the interaction history, the opponent has shown a tendency to play rock after scissors. In the last round, they played rock after I played paper. Given this pattern, it is likely that they will play rock again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

7. **Round 6:** I played paper, opponent played paper. It was a tie (0 reward).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played paper twice, rock twice, and scissors twice. This suggests a balanced distribution of choices, which could indicate a random strategy or a simple pattern.
- When I played paper, I won twice and tied once. This suggests that paper is a relatively safe choice against the opponent's strategy.
- When I played scissors, I won once and tied once. This also suggests that scissors can be effective.
- When I played rock, I lost. This suggests that rock might not be the best choice against the opponent's strategy.

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent's strategy appears to be either random or follows a simple pattern where each choice is equally likely. Given the current data, there is no clear pattern that the opponent is favoring one choice over the others. However, playing paper has given me a positive reward more consistently, which might indicate that the opponent plays rock slightly more often or that paper is a safer choice against their strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern with balanced choice distribution',
'value': 0.05700000000000005,
'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the interaction history, the opponent has played each option at least twice, suggesting a balanced or random strategy. Given the last play was 'paper', and considering the previous pattern where they played 'rock' after 'paper', I predict their next play might be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock', my best play would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's likely strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost (-1 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. It was a tie (0 reward).
3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I won (3 reward).
4. **Round 3**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper'. I won (3 reward).
5. **Round 4**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. It was a tie (0 reward).
6. **Round 5**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I won (3 reward).
7. **Round 6**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper'. It was a tie (0 reward).
8. **Round 7**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors'. I lost (-1 reward).

**Step-by-step Analysis:**

- The opponent has played 'paper' twice (rounds 0 and 6), 'scissors' twice (rounds 1 and 4), and 'rock' twice (rounds 2 and 5). In round 7, they played 'scissors' again.
- The opponent's choices seem to be cycling through 'paper', 'scissors', and 'rock', but not in a strict order. However, they have repeated 'scissors' after 'paper' in rounds 1 and 7.
- The opponent's strategy might be a pattern or a cycle that is not immediately obvious, but they seem to have a tendency to play 'scissors' after 'paper'.

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent might be using a strategy that involves playing 'scissors' after 'paper'. This is observed in rounds 1 and 7. They might be cycling through 'paper', 'scissors', and 'rock' in a non-linear pattern.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Plays scissors after paper, possibly cycling through paper, scissors, rock in a non-linear pattern'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing scissors after paper and potentially cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, their last play was scissors. Following this pattern, their next likely play is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Plays scissors after paper, possibly cycling through paper, scissors, rock in a non-linear pattern', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine my opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
2. **Round 1**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. It was a tie.
3. **Round 2**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
5. **Round 4**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. It was a tie.
6. **Round 5**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
7. **Round 6**: I played paper, opponent played paper. It was a tie.
8. **Round 7**: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.
9. **Round 8**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.

From this history, let's look for patterns:

- The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) three times in the first nine rounds.
- When I played paper, I won against rock twice (rounds 2 and 5) and lost to scissors once (round 7).
- When I played scissors, I won against paper once (round 3) and tied twice (rounds 1 and 4).
- When I played rock, I lost to paper once (round 0).

The opponent's plays seem to follow a pattern where they cycle through rock, paper, and scissors, but not in a straightforward sequence. They might be using a non-linear pattern, possibly influenced by my previous plays.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**
- The opponent might be cycling through rock, paper, and scissors in a pattern that is not immediately obvious, possibly influenced by my previous plays.
- They seem to play rock after I play paper, as seen in rounds 2, 5, and 8.
- They played scissors after I played paper in round 7, which could indicate a pattern or a reaction to my repeated paper plays.

Given this analysis, my hypothesis is that the opponent is cycling through rock, paper, and scissors in a non-linear pattern, possibly influenced by my previous plays. They might play rock after I play paper, but this is not guaranteed every time.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors in a non-linear pattern, possibly influenced by my previous plays. Likely to play rock after I play paper, but not guaranteed.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors in a non-linear pattern, and considering that they played rock after I played paper in the last round, it is likely that they might switch to scissors next, as they have shown a tendency to change their play after I use paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0:** I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
2. **Round 1:** I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
3. **Round 2:** I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
4. **Round 3:** I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
5. **Round 4:** I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
6. **Round 5:** I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
7. **Round 6:** I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.
8. **Round 7:** I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.
9. **Round 8:** I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
10. **Round 9:** I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played paper three times (rounds 0, 6, and 9), scissors twice (rounds 1 and 7), and rock three times (rounds 2, 5, and 8).
- The opponent's choice seems to be somewhat balanced among the three options, but there might be a pattern.
- The previous hypothesis suggested that the opponent might cycle through paper, scissors, and rock in a non-linear pattern.
- The opponent's play after paper was scissors (round 7), and after scissors, it was rock (round 8), which supports the cycling hypothesis.
- However, the opponent played paper again in round 9, which might indicate a reset or a more complex pattern.

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent might be cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, but not in a strict sequence. They might have a tendency to play paper more frequently after a rock or a reset to paper after a cycle. The pattern is not strictly linear, but there is a tendency to follow a cycle with occasional resets.

**Positive/Negative Reward Analysis:**

- Playing paper has generally given positive rewards, especially against rock.
- Playing rock has resulted in negative rewards against paper.
- Playing scissors has been effective against paper.

**Strategy:**

Given the tendency to cycle with occasional resets, I should consider playing scissors more frequently to counter the expected paper plays, while being cautious of potential resets.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.55,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, and considering their last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely next play is scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.

                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Plays scissors after paper, possibly cycling through paper, scissors, rock in a non-linear pattern', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
2. **Round 1**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
3. **Round 2**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
5. **Round 4**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
6. **Round 5**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
7. **Round 6**: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.
8. **Round 7**: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.
9. **Round 8**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
10. **Round 9**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
11. **Round 10**: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.

From this data, let's try to identify a pattern:

- The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
- There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays rock after playing paper (rounds 2, 5, 8).
- The opponent has played scissors after playing paper (round 7).
- The opponent played paper after playing rock (round 0, 9).

Given these observations, the opponent seems to be cycling through a sequence, but not in a straightforward manner. The previous hypothesis suggested a cycle of paper, scissors, rock, but the data doesn't fully support this. Instead, the opponent might be using a more complex pattern, potentially reacting to my plays or following a non-linear cycle.

**Positive/Negative Reward Analysis:**
- Playing rock: 1 win, 2 losses.
- Playing paper: 3 wins, 1 loss, 1 tie.
- Playing scissors: 1 win, 1 tie.

The most successful play so far has been paper, which suggests that the opponent might be playing rock more frequently after paper. However, the opponent's pattern is not entirely clear, and they might be adapting or using a more complex cycle.

**Refined Hypothesis:**
The opponent seems to have a tendency to play rock after paper and paper after rock, with occasional plays of scissors. This could indicate a non-linear cycle or a pattern that reacts to my previous plays.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Tends to play rock after paper and paper after rock, with occasional scissors. Possible non-linear cycle or reaction to my plays.',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's tendency to play rock after paper and paper after rock, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely they will revert to rock, following their pattern of alternating between rock and paper with occasional scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Opponent played paper against my rock. Result: Loss.
2. **Round 1**: Opponent played scissors against my scissors. Result: Tie.
3. **Round 2**: Opponent played rock against my paper. Result: Win.
4. **Round 3**: Opponent played paper against my scissors. Result: Win.
5. **Round 4**: Opponent played scissors against my scissors. Result: Tie.
6. **Round 5**: Opponent played rock against my paper. Result: Win.
7. **Round 6**: Opponent played paper against my paper. Result: Tie.
8. **Round 7**: Opponent played scissors against my paper. Result: Loss.
9. **Round 8**: Opponent played rock against my paper. Result: Win.
10. **Round 9**: Opponent played paper against my rock. Result: Loss.
11. **Round 10**: Opponent played scissors against my rock. Result: Win.
12. **Round 11**: Opponent played rock against my paper. Result: Win.
13. **Round 12**: Opponent played paper against my paper. Result: Tie.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent seems to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, but not in a strict sequence. 
- There is a tendency for the opponent to play paper after playing rock or after a reset.
- The opponent has played paper 5 times, scissors 3 times, and rock 4 times in the first 13 rounds.
- The hypothesis from round 10 suggested a cycle with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, which aligns with the observed data.
- The opponent's strategy might involve a pattern with a slight bias towards paper after certain plays.

**Positive/Negative Reward Analysis:**

- Playing paper has given me positive rewards against rock and ties against paper.
- Playing rock has given me mixed results: losses against paper and wins against scissors.
- Playing scissors has given me wins against paper and ties against scissors.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**

The opponent's strategy seems to involve cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after playing rock or after a reset. This aligns with the previous hypothesis, and the observed data supports this pattern.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, and considering their last play was paper, it is likely they will continue the cycle and play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Plays scissors after paper, possibly cycling through paper, scissors, rock in a non-linear pattern', 'value': 0.23193000000000008, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and identify any patterns:

1. **Rounds 0, 9, 13**: Opponent played 'paper' against my 'rock', resulting in a loss for me.
2. **Rounds 1, 4**: Opponent played 'scissors' against my 'scissors', resulting in a tie.
3. **Rounds 2, 5, 8, 11**: Opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper', resulting in a win for me.
4. **Rounds 3, 10**: Opponent played 'paper' against my 'scissors', resulting in a win for me.
5. **Round 6, 12**: Opponent played 'paper' against my 'paper', resulting in a tie.
6. **Round 7**: Opponent played 'scissors' against my 'paper', resulting in a loss for me.

From this data, we can observe the following:

- The opponent seems to play 'paper' frequently, especially after I play 'rock' or 'paper'.
- The opponent plays 'rock' when I play 'paper', which is advantageous for me.
- The opponent plays 'scissors' when I play 'paper', which is disadvantageous for me.

Given these observations, the opponent might be cycling through 'paper', 'scissors', and 'rock' in a non-linear pattern, with a tendency to play 'paper' more often. This aligns with my previous hypothesis that the opponent might be cycling through these plays.

**Hypothesis:**
The opponent is likely following a pattern where they play 'paper' frequently, especially after I play 'rock' or 'paper'. They might be cycling through 'paper', 'scissors', and 'rock', but with a bias towards 'paper'. This suggests a potential strategy of playing 'scissors' more often to counter their frequent 'paper' plays.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Plays paper frequently, possibly cycling through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards paper',
'value': 0.23193000000000008,
'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's tendency to play paper frequently and the recent pattern of their plays, it is likely that they will continue with paper in the next round. The opponent has shown a bias towards paper, especially after I played rock in the last round, which they successfully countered with paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my best move would be to play scissors. Scissors will beat paper, allowing me to gain a reward if the opponent indeed plays paper as predicted.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {14: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Plays paper frequently, possibly cycling through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards paper', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's likely policy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Frequency Analysis**: 
   - Paper: Played 6 times (Rounds 0, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14)
   - Scissors: Played 3 times (Rounds 1, 4, 7)
   - Rock: Played 2 times (Rounds 2, 5, 8, 10, 11)

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to play paper more frequently than the other two options.
   - There is no clear cyclic pattern (like rock-paper-scissors) observed yet, but paper appears more often, suggesting a bias.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I played scissors, I won against paper (Rounds 3, 14).
   - When I played paper, I won against rock (Rounds 2, 5, 8, 11).
   - When I played rock, I lost against paper (Rounds 0, 9, 13).

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to have a bias towards playing paper, as it has been their most frequent choice.
   - There is no strong evidence of a complex strategy or adaptation to my plays.
   - The opponent might be using a simple strategy with a preference for paper, possibly due to a static or semi-random algorithm.

5. **Strategy**:
   - Given the opponent's bias towards paper, playing scissors more frequently could be beneficial to exploit this tendency.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is that the opponent has a bias towards playing paper, and I should consider playing scissors more often to counter this.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Bias towards playing paper, with occasional plays of scissors and rock',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
        'my_next_play': 'scissors'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's bias towards playing paper and their recent plays, it is likely that they will continue with paper. They have shown a pattern of playing paper frequently, and since I last played scissors, they might not adapt immediately.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent will play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
2. **Round 1**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
3. **Round 2**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
5. **Round 4**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
6. **Round 5**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
7. **Round 6**: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.
8. **Round 7**: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.
9. **Round 8**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
10. **Round 9**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
11. **Round 10**: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.
12. **Round 11**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
13. **Round 12**: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.
14. **Round 13**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
15. **Round 14**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
16. **Round 15**: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
- The opponent's plays do not seem to follow a simple repeating pattern like "rock, paper, scissors" or any other fixed sequence.
- The opponent has played paper 6 times, rock 5 times, and scissors 4 times.
- When I play paper, I have a higher chance of winning (3 wins, 2 ties, 1 loss).
- When I play rock, I tend to lose more often (1 win, 3 losses).
- When I play scissors, I have mixed results (2 wins, 1 tie, 2 losses).

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent might be playing a strategy that favors paper slightly more than the other options, but not in a fixed sequence. This could be a random strategy with a slight bias towards paper. Given this, playing paper seems to yield the most positive results for me.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Random with slight bias towards paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of being random with a slight bias towards paper, and considering their last play was rock, it is likely they might switch back to their bias and play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter would be to play scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {16: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random with slight bias towards paper', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and my previous hypothesis:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has played paper 6 times, rock 3 times, and scissors 4 times in the last 17 rounds.
   - The opponent's plays are distributed as follows:
     - Paper: Rounds 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 16
     - Rock: Rounds 2, 5, 11
     - Scissors: Rounds 1, 4, 7, 15

2. **Pattern Observation:**
   - Paper appears more frequently than rock or scissors, suggesting a bias towards paper.
   - The opponent's plays do not seem to follow a strict pattern or sequence, indicating a possible random element.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards were obtained when I played scissors against paper (rounds 3, 14, 16) and paper against rock (rounds 2, 5, 11).
   - Negative rewards occurred when I played rock against paper (rounds 0, 9, 13) and scissors against rock (round 15).

4. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a "Random with slight bias towards paper" strategy, which aligns with the observed data.
   - The opponent's frequent use of paper supports this hypothesis, and my positive rewards when playing scissors against paper reinforce it.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent likely employs a strategy with a random element but shows a slight bias towards playing paper. This can be exploited by favoring scissors, which counters paper effectively.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to use scissors more frequently to exploit the opponent's bias towards paper.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Random with slight bias towards paper',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
        'my_next_play': 'scissors'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the previous rounds and the identified strategy of the opponent, which is 'Random with slight bias towards paper', it seems that the opponent has a tendency to play paper more frequently. In the last round, they played paper, and considering their bias, it is likely they will play paper again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, the best choice for me would be to play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

15. **Round 14**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper'. I won (3).
16. **Round 15**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock'. I lost (-1).
17. **Round 16**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper'. I won (3).
18. **Round 17**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. Tie (0).

**Analysis**:
- The opponent has played 'rock' 4 times, 'paper' 6 times, and 'scissors' 4 times.
- There seems to be a higher frequency of 'paper' plays by the opponent.
- When I play 'paper', I have won 3 times, tied 2 times, and lost 1 time. This suggests that the opponent plays 'rock' often enough to make 'paper' a beneficial choice.
- When I play 'scissors', I have won 3 times, tied 2 times, and lost 1 time. This suggests that the opponent also plays 'paper' frequently.
- When I play 'rock', I have won 1 time and lost 3 times, indicating that 'rock' is not a favorable choice against the opponent's strategy.

**Hypothesis**:
The opponent seems to favor 'paper' slightly more than the other options, but they also play 'rock' and 'scissors' with some regularity. A strategy that favors 'scissors' might exploit the opponent's tendency to play 'paper'.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Favors paper slightly, but plays rock and scissors regularly. Scissors is a favorable counter.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of favoring paper slightly but also playing rock and scissors regularly, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent might switch to rock to counter my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent might play rock next, my best counter would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.

                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {18: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Favors paper slightly, but plays rock and scissors regularly. Scissors is a favorable counter.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - The opponent's plays seem to be distributed across all three options without a clear pattern of repetition.

2. **Frequency Analysis**:
   - **Rock**: Played in rounds 2, 5, 8, 11, 18 (5 times)
   - **Paper**: Played in rounds 0, 6, 9, 12, 13 (5 times)
   - **Scissors**: Played in rounds 1, 4, 7, 10, 15, 17 (6 times)

3. **Outcome Analysis**:
   - When I played **paper**, I won against rock (rounds 2, 5, 8, 11, 18) and tied against paper (rounds 6, 12).
   - When I played **scissors**, I won against paper (rounds 3, 14, 16) and tied against scissors (rounds 1, 4, 17).
   - When I played **rock**, I lost to paper (rounds 0, 9, 13) and won against scissors (round 10).

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to favor playing rock and paper equally, with a slight inclination towards scissors.
   - My previous hypothesis suggested that scissors is a favorable counter, which aligns with the observation that I have won multiple times using scissors against their paper plays.

5. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - Given the distribution of the opponent's plays, continuing to use scissors seems advantageous as it counters their paper and ties with their scissors.
   - Paper also appears to be a strong choice as it counters their rock plays, which have been frequent.

In conclusion, the opponent's strategy appears to be a balanced distribution among rock, paper, and scissors, with a slight favor towards scissors. My strategy should focus on using scissors and paper to maximize my rewards.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Balanced distribution among rock, paper, and scissors, with a slight favor towards scissors. Scissors and paper are favorable counters.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
        'my_next_play': 'paper'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the interaction history, the opponent has shown a balanced distribution among rock, paper, and scissors, with a slight favor towards scissors. However, in the last round, they played rock. Given this pattern and the fact that I played paper successfully against their rock, they might switch to scissors to counter my paper. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {19: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Balanced distribution among rock, paper, and scissors, with a slight favor towards scissors. Scissors and paper are favorable counters.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and examine the patterns:

1. **Frequency of Plays**: 
   - Rock: 5 times (Rounds 2, 5, 8, 11, 18)
   - Paper: 5 times (Rounds 0, 6, 9, 12, 13)
   - Scissors: 9 times (Rounds 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19)

2. **Outcome Analysis**:
   - When I played Rock: 
     - Wins: 3 (Rounds 10, 19)
     - Losses: 3 (Rounds 0, 9, 13)
   - When I played Paper:
     - Wins: 4 (Rounds 2, 5, 8, 11, 18)
     - Losses: 1 (Round 7)
   - When I played Scissors:
     - Wins: 3 (Rounds 3, 14, 16)
     - Losses: 1 (Round 15)

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent has shown a slight favor towards playing Scissors, as it has been played 9 times out of 19 rounds.
   - The opponent's plays seem to be distributed among Rock, Paper, and Scissors, but with a noticeable inclination towards Scissors.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a balanced distribution among Rock, Paper, and Scissors, with a slight favor towards Scissors. This is consistent with the previous hypothesis.
   - Given the frequency of Scissors, playing Rock has been effective in recent rounds, suggesting that the opponent might continue this pattern.

5. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - Since playing Rock has yielded positive rewards recently, and considering the opponent's tendency to favor Scissors, continuing to play Rock might be a beneficial strategy.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the previous observation:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Balanced distribution among rock, paper, and scissors, with a slight favor towards scissors. Scissors and paper are favorable counters.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's balanced distribution strategy with a slight favor towards scissors, and considering their last play was scissors which I countered successfully with rock, they might switch to paper to counter my rock. However, since they have a slight favor towards scissors, they might also continue with scissors. Given this, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted scissors play, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent's plays in the first few rounds were: paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock.
   - This sequence suggests a cyclic pattern of "paper, scissors, rock."

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent seems to be cycling through "paper, scissors, rock" consistently.
   - There are occasional resets to paper, but the cycle is quite evident.

3. **Previous Hypothesis:**
   - The previous hypothesis suggested that the opponent cycles through "paper, scissors, rock" with occasional resets to paper, and tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

4. **Verification Against History:**
   - The interaction history supports this hypothesis. The opponent's plays align with the predicted cycle of "paper, scissors, rock."
   - The hypothesis accurately predicted the opponent's next play as rock in round 20, which was correct.

5. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards were received when playing paper against rock and scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards were received when playing rock against paper and scissors against rock.
   - This further supports the cyclic pattern hypothesis, as playing the counter to the expected play in the cycle yields positive rewards.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent is likely following a simple cyclic strategy of "paper, scissors, rock" with occasional resets to paper.
   - This strategy can be exploited by predicting the next play in the cycle and playing the counter move.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the observed data, and the strategy can be effectively countered by anticipating the cycle.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.237,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper, and considering their last play was rock, it is likely that their next play will be paper. This follows the observed pattern where they tend to play paper after rock or a reset.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```
