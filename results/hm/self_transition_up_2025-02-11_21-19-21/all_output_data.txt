Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0 Analysis**:
   - I played: Rock
   - Opponent played: Paper
   - Outcome: I lost (reward: -1)

From this single round, it's difficult to determine a clear strategy from the opponent. However, we can consider a few possibilities:

- **Static Strategy**: The opponent might be playing a static strategy where they always choose paper. This would explain the outcome of the first round, but with only one data point, this is speculative.

- **Random Strategy**: The opponent could be playing randomly, and paper was chosen by chance in this round.

- **Adaptive Strategy**: The opponent might be trying to counter my previous play. However, since this is the first round, they wouldn't have any prior data to adapt from.

Given that I received a negative reward when playing rock, it suggests that playing rock might not be a safe choice if the opponent continues to play paper. However, with only one round of data, it's too early to make a definitive conclusion about their strategy.

For now, the most straightforward hypothesis is that the opponent might be playing paper consistently, but this needs further rounds to confirm.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Possibly static paper, but more data needed'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent played paper in the first round and my initial guess is that they might be using a static paper strategy, I believe their next play will likely be paper again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is likely to play paper again, my best counter move would be scissors to beat their paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', and the opponent played 'paper'. I received a reward of -1, indicating a loss. This suggests that the opponent's choice of 'paper' was effective against my 'rock'.

2. **Round 1**: I played 'scissors', and the opponent played 'scissors'. I received a reward of 0, indicating a tie. This suggests that the opponent's choice of 'scissors' was not influenced by my previous choice of 'rock'.

From these two rounds, we can consider a few possibilities:

- **Static Strategy**: The opponent might be playing a static strategy, such as always playing 'paper' or 'scissors'. However, since they played different moves in the first two rounds, this is less likely.

- **Random Strategy**: The opponent could be playing randomly, which would explain the different moves in the first two rounds.

- **Pattern or Cycle**: The opponent might be following a pattern or cycle, such as 'paper' followed by 'scissors'. However, with only two rounds, it's difficult to determine a specific pattern.

- **Counter Strategy**: The opponent might be trying to counter my moves, but with only two rounds, there's insufficient evidence to support this.

Given the limited data, the most straightforward hypothesis is that the opponent might be playing randomly or following a simple pattern. As more rounds are played, this hypothesis can be refined.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern (insufficient data for a clear pattern)'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that the opponent's strategy appears random or follows a simple pattern, and considering the last two plays were 'paper' and 'scissors', the opponent might choose 'rock' next to complete the cycle or continue with a random choice. However, without a clear pattern, predicting 'rock' is a reasonable assumption.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent might play 'rock', my next play should be 'paper' to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern (insufficient data for a clear pattern)', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost (-1 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. It was a tie (0 reward).
3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I won (+3 reward).

From this data, we can make the following observations:

- The opponent has played each option ('rock', 'paper', 'scissors') once in the first three rounds. This could suggest a random strategy or a simple pattern.
- My previous hypothesis suggested that the opponent might play 'rock' next, which was correct for round 2. This could indicate a pattern where the opponent cycles through 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors' in order, but there is insufficient data to confirm this yet.

Given that I received a positive reward when playing 'paper' in round 2, it might be beneficial to continue playing 'paper' if the opponent is likely to play 'rock' again. However, since the opponent has played each option once, they might be cycling through them or playing randomly.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**
- The opponent might be playing a simple pattern, possibly cycling through 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors'. However, with only three rounds of data, this is not definitive.
- Alternatively, the opponent could be playing randomly, as each option has been played once.

**Conclusion:**
- Continue monitoring the opponent's plays to determine if a pattern emerges.
- For now, playing 'paper' could be a safe choice if the opponent repeats 'rock'.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern (insufficient data for a clear pattern)',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
        'my_next_play': 'paper'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the interaction history, the opponent has played 'paper', 'scissors', and 'rock' in sequence. This suggests a possible pattern of cycling through the options. If this pattern continues, their next play might be 'paper'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'paper' play by the opponent, I should play 'scissors', as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {2: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern (insufficient data for a clear pattern)', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I received a reward of -1. This suggests the opponent countered my 'rock' with 'paper'.

2. **Round 1**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. I received a reward of 0. This indicates a tie, so no clear advantage or pattern from the opponent.

3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I received a reward of 3. This suggests the opponent played 'rock', which I countered successfully with 'paper'.

4. **Round 3**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper'. I received a reward of 3. This suggests the opponent played 'paper', which I countered successfully with 'scissors'.

From this analysis, the opponent's plays have been: 'paper', 'scissors', 'rock', 'paper'. This sequence doesn't immediately suggest a clear pattern like a cyclic strategy (e.g., rock-paper-scissors) or a static strategy. However, the opponent has played 'paper' twice in four rounds, which might indicate a preference or a simple pattern.

Given the previous hypothesis that the opponent might be playing randomly or following a simple pattern, and the fact that I received positive rewards when playing 'scissors' against 'paper', it seems beneficial to continue playing 'scissors' until a clearer pattern emerges.

In summary, the opponent's strategy could still be random or a simple pattern, with a slight inclination towards playing 'paper'. Therefore, playing 'scissors' might continue to yield positive results.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern with a slight inclination towards paper',
    'value': 0.51,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
        'my_next_play': 'scissors'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the interaction history, the opponent has shown a slight inclination towards playing paper, having played it twice in the last four rounds. Given this pattern and the fact that I last played scissors, which beats paper, the opponent might anticipate this and switch to rock to counter my scissors. However, considering their slight inclination towards paper, they might continue with paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, I should play scissors again. If they switch to rock, I will lose this round, but given their pattern, playing scissors is a reasonable strategy to maximize my chances of winning.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {3: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern (insufficient data for a clear pattern)', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost (-1 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. It's a tie (0 reward).
3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I won (+3 reward).
4. **Round 3**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper'. I won (+3 reward).
5. **Round 4**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. It's a tie (0 reward).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played 'paper', 'scissors', 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors' in sequence.
- There is no clear pattern yet, but we can observe:
  - The opponent has repeated 'scissors' twice (rounds 1 and 4).
  - The opponent has repeated 'paper' twice (rounds 0 and 3).
  - The opponent has played each option at least once in the first five rounds.

**Hypothesis:**

- The opponent might be playing a random strategy or a simple pattern that is not yet clear due to insufficient data.
- The opponent's plays do not seem to be directly countering my previous plays, suggesting a lack of adaptation.
- I have received positive rewards when playing 'paper' and 'scissors', but not consistently enough to determine a static strategy from the opponent.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited data, the opponent's strategy could still be random or a simple pattern. I will continue to monitor for any emerging patterns or repetitions in their plays.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern (insufficient data for a clear pattern)',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
        'my_next_play': 'scissors'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the interaction history, the opponent has played scissors twice in a row. Given the previous prediction that the opponent might play paper, and considering the possibility of a random or simple pattern, the opponent might switch to rock to counter my last play of scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': If the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Top hypotheses: {5: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern (insufficient data for a clear pattern)', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0:** I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost (-1 reward).
2. **Round 1:** I played scissors, opponent played scissors. It was a tie (0 reward).
3. **Round 2:** I played paper, opponent played rock. I won (3 reward).
4. **Round 3:** I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won (3 reward).
5. **Round 4:** I played scissors, opponent played scissors. It was a tie (0 reward).
6. **Round 5:** I played paper, opponent played rock. I won (3 reward).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played rock twice (rounds 2 and 5), paper twice (rounds 0 and 3), and scissors twice (rounds 1 and 4).
- There is no clear pattern in the opponent's plays that suggests a static strategy like always playing the same move.
- However, the opponent has played rock after playing scissors in rounds 1 and 4, which might suggest a tendency to play rock after scissors.
- My wins have occurred when I played paper against the opponent's rock (rounds 2 and 5) and scissors against the opponent's paper (round 3).
- The opponent's plays seem to be somewhat balanced across rock, paper, and scissors, which might indicate a random or simple pattern strategy.

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent might be playing a strategy that involves a random or simple pattern, with a slight tendency to play rock after scissors. This hypothesis is based on the limited data available and may need further refinement as more rounds are played.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern with a tendency to play rock after scissors',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
        'my_next_play': 'paper'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the interaction history, the opponent has shown a tendency to play rock after scissors. In the last round, they played rock after I played paper. Given this pattern, it is likely that they will play rock again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

7. **Round 6:** I played paper, opponent played paper. It was a tie (0 reward).

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played paper twice, rock twice, and scissors twice. This suggests a balanced distribution of choices, which could indicate a random strategy or a simple pattern.
- When I played paper, I won twice and tied once. This suggests that paper is a relatively safe choice against the opponent's strategy.
- When I played scissors, I won once and tied once. This also suggests that scissors can be effective.
- When I played rock, I lost. This suggests that rock might not be the best choice against the opponent's strategy.

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent's strategy appears to be either random or follows a simple pattern where each choice is equally likely. Given the current data, there is no clear pattern that the opponent is favoring one choice over the others. However, playing paper has given me a positive reward more consistently, which might indicate that the opponent plays rock slightly more often or that paper is a safer choice against their strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Random or simple pattern with balanced choice distribution',
'value': 0.05700000000000005,
'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the interaction history, the opponent has played each option at least twice, suggesting a balanced or random strategy. Given the last play was 'paper', and considering the previous pattern where they played 'rock' after 'paper', I predict their next play might be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock', my best play would be 'paper', as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's likely strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played 'rock', opponent played 'paper'. I lost (-1 reward).
2. **Round 1**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. It was a tie (0 reward).
3. **Round 2**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I won (3 reward).
4. **Round 3**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper'. I won (3 reward).
5. **Round 4**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. It was a tie (0 reward).
6. **Round 5**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'rock'. I won (3 reward).
7. **Round 6**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'paper'. It was a tie (0 reward).
8. **Round 7**: I played 'paper', opponent played 'scissors'. I lost (-1 reward).

**Step-by-step Analysis:**

- The opponent has played 'paper' twice (rounds 0 and 6), 'scissors' twice (rounds 1 and 4), and 'rock' twice (rounds 2 and 5). In round 7, they played 'scissors' again.
- The opponent's choices seem to be cycling through 'paper', 'scissors', and 'rock', but not in a strict order. However, they have repeated 'scissors' after 'paper' in rounds 1 and 7.
- The opponent's strategy might be a pattern or a cycle that is not immediately obvious, but they seem to have a tendency to play 'scissors' after 'paper'.

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent might be using a strategy that involves playing 'scissors' after 'paper'. This is observed in rounds 1 and 7. They might be cycling through 'paper', 'scissors', and 'rock' in a non-linear pattern.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Plays scissors after paper, possibly cycling through paper, scissors, rock in a non-linear pattern'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of playing scissors after paper and potentially cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, their last play was scissors. Following this pattern, their next likely play is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Plays scissors after paper, possibly cycling through paper, scissors, rock in a non-linear pattern', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine my opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Round 0**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
2. **Round 1**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. It was a tie.
3. **Round 2**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
5. **Round 4**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. It was a tie.
6. **Round 5**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
7. **Round 6**: I played paper, opponent played paper. It was a tie.
8. **Round 7**: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.
9. **Round 8**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.

From this history, let's look for patterns:

- The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) three times in the first nine rounds.
- When I played paper, I won against rock twice (rounds 2 and 5) and lost to scissors once (round 7).
- When I played scissors, I won against paper once (round 3) and tied twice (rounds 1 and 4).
- When I played rock, I lost to paper once (round 0).

The opponent's plays seem to follow a pattern where they cycle through rock, paper, and scissors, but not in a straightforward sequence. They might be using a non-linear pattern, possibly influenced by my previous plays.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**
- The opponent might be cycling through rock, paper, and scissors in a pattern that is not immediately obvious, possibly influenced by my previous plays.
- They seem to play rock after I play paper, as seen in rounds 2, 5, and 8.
- They played scissors after I played paper in round 7, which could indicate a pattern or a reaction to my repeated paper plays.

Given this analysis, my hypothesis is that the opponent is cycling through rock, paper, and scissors in a non-linear pattern, possibly influenced by my previous plays. They might play rock after I play paper, but this is not guaranteed every time.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors in a non-linear pattern, possibly influenced by my previous plays. Likely to play rock after I play paper, but not guaranteed.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors in a non-linear pattern, and considering that they played rock after I played paper in the last round, it is likely that they might switch to scissors next, as they have shown a tendency to change their play after I use paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0:** I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
2. **Round 1:** I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
3. **Round 2:** I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
4. **Round 3:** I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
5. **Round 4:** I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
6. **Round 5:** I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
7. **Round 6:** I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.
8. **Round 7:** I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.
9. **Round 8:** I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
10. **Round 9:** I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played paper three times (rounds 0, 6, and 9), scissors twice (rounds 1 and 7), and rock three times (rounds 2, 5, and 8).
- The opponent's choice seems to be somewhat balanced among the three options, but there might be a pattern.
- The previous hypothesis suggested that the opponent might cycle through paper, scissors, and rock in a non-linear pattern.
- The opponent's play after paper was scissors (round 7), and after scissors, it was rock (round 8), which supports the cycling hypothesis.
- However, the opponent played paper again in round 9, which might indicate a reset or a more complex pattern.

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent might be cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, but not in a strict sequence. They might have a tendency to play paper more frequently after a rock or a reset to paper after a cycle. The pattern is not strictly linear, but there is a tendency to follow a cycle with occasional resets.

**Positive/Negative Reward Analysis:**

- Playing paper has generally given positive rewards, especially against rock.
- Playing rock has resulted in negative rewards against paper.
- Playing scissors has been effective against paper.

**Strategy:**

Given the tendency to cycle with occasional resets, I should consider playing scissors more frequently to counter the expected paper plays, while being cautious of potential resets.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.55,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, and considering their last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely next play is scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.

                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Plays scissors after paper, possibly cycling through paper, scissors, rock in a non-linear pattern', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
2. **Round 1**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
3. **Round 2**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
5. **Round 4**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
6. **Round 5**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
7. **Round 6**: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.
8. **Round 7**: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.
9. **Round 8**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
10. **Round 9**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
11. **Round 10**: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.

From this data, let's try to identify a pattern:

- The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
- There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays rock after playing paper (rounds 2, 5, 8).
- The opponent has played scissors after playing paper (round 7).
- The opponent played paper after playing rock (round 0, 9).

Given these observations, the opponent seems to be cycling through a sequence, but not in a straightforward manner. The previous hypothesis suggested a cycle of paper, scissors, rock, but the data doesn't fully support this. Instead, the opponent might be using a more complex pattern, potentially reacting to my plays or following a non-linear cycle.

**Positive/Negative Reward Analysis:**
- Playing rock: 1 win, 2 losses.
- Playing paper: 3 wins, 1 loss, 1 tie.
- Playing scissors: 1 win, 1 tie.

The most successful play so far has been paper, which suggests that the opponent might be playing rock more frequently after paper. However, the opponent's pattern is not entirely clear, and they might be adapting or using a more complex cycle.

**Refined Hypothesis:**
The opponent seems to have a tendency to play rock after paper and paper after rock, with occasional plays of scissors. This could indicate a non-linear cycle or a pattern that reacts to my previous plays.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Tends to play rock after paper and paper after rock, with occasional scissors. Possible non-linear cycle or reaction to my plays.',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's tendency to play rock after paper and paper after rock, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely they will revert to rock, following their pattern of alternating between rock and paper with occasional scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: Opponent played paper against my rock. Result: Loss.
2. **Round 1**: Opponent played scissors against my scissors. Result: Tie.
3. **Round 2**: Opponent played rock against my paper. Result: Win.
4. **Round 3**: Opponent played paper against my scissors. Result: Win.
5. **Round 4**: Opponent played scissors against my scissors. Result: Tie.
6. **Round 5**: Opponent played rock against my paper. Result: Win.
7. **Round 6**: Opponent played paper against my paper. Result: Tie.
8. **Round 7**: Opponent played scissors against my paper. Result: Loss.
9. **Round 8**: Opponent played rock against my paper. Result: Win.
10. **Round 9**: Opponent played paper against my rock. Result: Loss.
11. **Round 10**: Opponent played scissors against my rock. Result: Win.
12. **Round 11**: Opponent played rock against my paper. Result: Win.
13. **Round 12**: Opponent played paper against my paper. Result: Tie.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent seems to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, but not in a strict sequence. 
- There is a tendency for the opponent to play paper after playing rock or after a reset.
- The opponent has played paper 5 times, scissors 3 times, and rock 4 times in the first 13 rounds.
- The hypothesis from round 10 suggested a cycle with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, which aligns with the observed data.
- The opponent's strategy might involve a pattern with a slight bias towards paper after certain plays.

**Positive/Negative Reward Analysis:**

- Playing paper has given me positive rewards against rock and ties against paper.
- Playing rock has given me mixed results: losses against paper and wins against scissors.
- Playing scissors has given me wins against paper and ties against scissors.

**Hypothesis Refinement:**

The opponent's strategy seems to involve cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after playing rock or after a reset. This aligns with the previous hypothesis, and the observed data supports this pattern.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, and considering their last play was paper, it is likely they will continue the cycle and play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {8: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Plays scissors after paper, possibly cycling through paper, scissors, rock in a non-linear pattern', 'value': 0.23193000000000008, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and identify any patterns:

1. **Rounds 0, 9, 13**: Opponent played 'paper' against my 'rock', resulting in a loss for me.
2. **Rounds 1, 4**: Opponent played 'scissors' against my 'scissors', resulting in a tie.
3. **Rounds 2, 5, 8, 11**: Opponent played 'rock' against my 'paper', resulting in a win for me.
4. **Rounds 3, 10**: Opponent played 'paper' against my 'scissors', resulting in a win for me.
5. **Round 6, 12**: Opponent played 'paper' against my 'paper', resulting in a tie.
6. **Round 7**: Opponent played 'scissors' against my 'paper', resulting in a loss for me.

From this data, we can observe the following:

- The opponent seems to play 'paper' frequently, especially after I play 'rock' or 'paper'.
- The opponent plays 'rock' when I play 'paper', which is advantageous for me.
- The opponent plays 'scissors' when I play 'paper', which is disadvantageous for me.

Given these observations, the opponent might be cycling through 'paper', 'scissors', and 'rock' in a non-linear pattern, with a tendency to play 'paper' more often. This aligns with my previous hypothesis that the opponent might be cycling through these plays.

**Hypothesis:**
The opponent is likely following a pattern where they play 'paper' frequently, especially after I play 'rock' or 'paper'. They might be cycling through 'paper', 'scissors', and 'rock', but with a bias towards 'paper'. This suggests a potential strategy of playing 'scissors' more often to counter their frequent 'paper' plays.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Plays paper frequently, possibly cycling through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards paper',
'value': 0.23193000000000008,
'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's tendency to play paper frequently and the recent pattern of their plays, it is likely that they will continue with paper in the next round. The opponent has shown a bias towards paper, especially after I played rock in the last round, which they successfully countered with paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my best move would be to play scissors. Scissors will beat paper, allowing me to gain a reward if the opponent indeed plays paper as predicted.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {14: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Plays paper frequently, possibly cycling through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards paper', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's likely policy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Frequency Analysis**: 
   - Paper: Played 6 times (Rounds 0, 6, 9, 12, 13, 14)
   - Scissors: Played 3 times (Rounds 1, 4, 7)
   - Rock: Played 2 times (Rounds 2, 5, 8, 10, 11)

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to play paper more frequently than the other two options.
   - There is no clear cyclic pattern (like rock-paper-scissors) observed yet, but paper appears more often, suggesting a bias.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I played scissors, I won against paper (Rounds 3, 14).
   - When I played paper, I won against rock (Rounds 2, 5, 8, 11).
   - When I played rock, I lost against paper (Rounds 0, 9, 13).

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to have a bias towards playing paper, as it has been their most frequent choice.
   - There is no strong evidence of a complex strategy or adaptation to my plays.
   - The opponent might be using a simple strategy with a preference for paper, possibly due to a static or semi-random algorithm.

5. **Strategy**:
   - Given the opponent's bias towards paper, playing scissors more frequently could be beneficial to exploit this tendency.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is that the opponent has a bias towards playing paper, and I should consider playing scissors more often to counter this.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Bias towards playing paper, with occasional plays of scissors and rock',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
        'my_next_play': 'scissors'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's bias towards playing paper and their recent plays, it is likely that they will continue with paper. They have shown a pattern of playing paper frequently, and since I last played scissors, they might not adapt immediately.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent will play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history:

1. **Round 0**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
2. **Round 1**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
3. **Round 2**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
4. **Round 3**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
5. **Round 4**: I played scissors, opponent played scissors. Tie.
6. **Round 5**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
7. **Round 6**: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.
8. **Round 7**: I played paper, opponent played scissors. I lost.
9. **Round 8**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
10. **Round 9**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
11. **Round 10**: I played rock, opponent played scissors. I won.
12. **Round 11**: I played paper, opponent played rock. I won.
13. **Round 12**: I played paper, opponent played paper. Tie.
14. **Round 13**: I played rock, opponent played paper. I lost.
15. **Round 14**: I played scissors, opponent played paper. I won.
16. **Round 15**: I played scissors, opponent played rock. I lost.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

- The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
- The opponent's plays do not seem to follow a simple repeating pattern like "rock, paper, scissors" or any other fixed sequence.
- The opponent has played paper 6 times, rock 5 times, and scissors 4 times.
- When I play paper, I have a higher chance of winning (3 wins, 2 ties, 1 loss).
- When I play rock, I tend to lose more often (1 win, 3 losses).
- When I play scissors, I have mixed results (2 wins, 1 tie, 2 losses).

**Hypothesis:**

The opponent might be playing a strategy that favors paper slightly more than the other options, but not in a fixed sequence. This could be a random strategy with a slight bias towards paper. Given this, playing paper seems to yield the most positive results for me.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Random with slight bias towards paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of being random with a slight bias towards paper, and considering their last play was rock, it is likely they might switch back to their bias and play paper in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter would be to play scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {16: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Random with slight bias towards paper', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and my previous hypothesis:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has played paper 6 times, rock 3 times, and scissors 4 times in the last 17 rounds.
   - The opponent's plays are distributed as follows:
     - Paper: Rounds 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 16
     - Rock: Rounds 2, 5, 11
     - Scissors: Rounds 1, 4, 7, 15

2. **Pattern Observation:**
   - Paper appears more frequently than rock or scissors, suggesting a bias towards paper.
   - The opponent's plays do not seem to follow a strict pattern or sequence, indicating a possible random element.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards were obtained when I played scissors against paper (rounds 3, 14, 16) and paper against rock (rounds 2, 5, 11).
   - Negative rewards occurred when I played rock against paper (rounds 0, 9, 13) and scissors against rock (round 15).

4. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a "Random with slight bias towards paper" strategy, which aligns with the observed data.
   - The opponent's frequent use of paper supports this hypothesis, and my positive rewards when playing scissors against paper reinforce it.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent likely employs a strategy with a random element but shows a slight bias towards playing paper. This can be exploited by favoring scissors, which counters paper effectively.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to use scissors more frequently to exploit the opponent's bias towards paper.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Random with slight bias towards paper',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
        'my_next_play': 'scissors'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the previous rounds and the identified strategy of the opponent, which is 'Random with slight bias towards paper', it seems that the opponent has a tendency to play paper more frequently. In the last round, they played paper, and considering their bias, it is likely they will play paper again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, the best choice for me would be to play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

15. **Round 14**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper'. I won (3).
16. **Round 15**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'rock'. I lost (-1).
17. **Round 16**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'paper'. I won (3).
18. **Round 17**: I played 'scissors', opponent played 'scissors'. Tie (0).

**Analysis**:
- The opponent has played 'rock' 4 times, 'paper' 6 times, and 'scissors' 4 times.
- There seems to be a higher frequency of 'paper' plays by the opponent.
- When I play 'paper', I have won 3 times, tied 2 times, and lost 1 time. This suggests that the opponent plays 'rock' often enough to make 'paper' a beneficial choice.
- When I play 'scissors', I have won 3 times, tied 2 times, and lost 1 time. This suggests that the opponent also plays 'paper' frequently.
- When I play 'rock', I have won 1 time and lost 3 times, indicating that 'rock' is not a favorable choice against the opponent's strategy.

**Hypothesis**:
The opponent seems to favor 'paper' slightly more than the other options, but they also play 'rock' and 'scissors' with some regularity. A strategy that favors 'scissors' might exploit the opponent's tendency to play 'paper'.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Favors paper slightly, but plays rock and scissors regularly. Scissors is a favorable counter.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of favoring paper slightly but also playing rock and scissors regularly, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, the opponent might switch to rock to counter my scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent might play rock next, my best counter would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.

                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {18: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Favors paper slightly, but plays rock and scissors regularly. Scissors is a favorable counter.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - The opponent's plays seem to be distributed across all three options without a clear pattern of repetition.

2. **Frequency Analysis**:
   - **Rock**: Played in rounds 2, 5, 8, 11, 18 (5 times)
   - **Paper**: Played in rounds 0, 6, 9, 12, 13 (5 times)
   - **Scissors**: Played in rounds 1, 4, 7, 10, 15, 17 (6 times)

3. **Outcome Analysis**:
   - When I played **paper**, I won against rock (rounds 2, 5, 8, 11, 18) and tied against paper (rounds 6, 12).
   - When I played **scissors**, I won against paper (rounds 3, 14, 16) and tied against scissors (rounds 1, 4, 17).
   - When I played **rock**, I lost to paper (rounds 0, 9, 13) and won against scissors (round 10).

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to favor playing rock and paper equally, with a slight inclination towards scissors.
   - My previous hypothesis suggested that scissors is a favorable counter, which aligns with the observation that I have won multiple times using scissors against their paper plays.

5. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - Given the distribution of the opponent's plays, continuing to use scissors seems advantageous as it counters their paper and ties with their scissors.
   - Paper also appears to be a strong choice as it counters their rock plays, which have been frequent.

In conclusion, the opponent's strategy appears to be a balanced distribution among rock, paper, and scissors, with a slight favor towards scissors. My strategy should focus on using scissors and paper to maximize my rewards.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Balanced distribution among rock, paper, and scissors, with a slight favor towards scissors. Scissors and paper are favorable counters.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
        'my_next_play': 'paper'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the interaction history, the opponent has shown a balanced distribution among rock, paper, and scissors, with a slight favor towards scissors. However, in the last round, they played rock. Given this pattern and the fact that I played paper successfully against their rock, they might switch to scissors to counter my paper. Therefore, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {19: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Balanced distribution among rock, paper, and scissors, with a slight favor towards scissors. Scissors and paper are favorable counters.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and examine the patterns:

1. **Frequency of Plays**: 
   - Rock: 5 times (Rounds 2, 5, 8, 11, 18)
   - Paper: 5 times (Rounds 0, 6, 9, 12, 13)
   - Scissors: 9 times (Rounds 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19)

2. **Outcome Analysis**:
   - When I played Rock: 
     - Wins: 3 (Rounds 10, 19)
     - Losses: 3 (Rounds 0, 9, 13)
   - When I played Paper:
     - Wins: 4 (Rounds 2, 5, 8, 11, 18)
     - Losses: 1 (Round 7)
   - When I played Scissors:
     - Wins: 3 (Rounds 3, 14, 16)
     - Losses: 1 (Round 15)

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent has shown a slight favor towards playing Scissors, as it has been played 9 times out of 19 rounds.
   - The opponent's plays seem to be distributed among Rock, Paper, and Scissors, but with a noticeable inclination towards Scissors.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a balanced distribution among Rock, Paper, and Scissors, with a slight favor towards Scissors. This is consistent with the previous hypothesis.
   - Given the frequency of Scissors, playing Rock has been effective in recent rounds, suggesting that the opponent might continue this pattern.

5. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - Since playing Rock has yielded positive rewards recently, and considering the opponent's tendency to favor Scissors, continuing to play Rock might be a beneficial strategy.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the previous observation:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Balanced distribution among rock, paper, and scissors, with a slight favor towards scissors. Scissors and paper are favorable counters.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's balanced distribution strategy with a slight favor towards scissors, and considering their last play was scissors which I countered successfully with rock, they might switch to paper to counter my rock. However, since they have a slight favor towards scissors, they might also continue with scissors. Given this, I predict their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted scissors play, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent's plays in the first few rounds were: paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock.
   - This sequence suggests a cyclic pattern of "paper, scissors, rock."

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent seems to be cycling through "paper, scissors, rock" consistently.
   - There are occasional resets to paper, but the cycle is quite evident.

3. **Previous Hypothesis:**
   - The previous hypothesis suggested that the opponent cycles through "paper, scissors, rock" with occasional resets to paper, and tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

4. **Verification Against History:**
   - The interaction history supports this hypothesis. The opponent's plays align with the predicted cycle of "paper, scissors, rock."
   - The hypothesis accurately predicted the opponent's next play as rock in round 20, which was correct.

5. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards were received when playing paper against rock and scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards were received when playing rock against paper and scissors against rock.
   - This further supports the cyclic pattern hypothesis, as playing the counter to the expected play in the cycle yields positive rewards.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent is likely following a simple cyclic strategy of "paper, scissors, rock" with occasional resets to paper.
   - This strategy can be exploited by predicting the next play in the cycle and playing the counter move.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the observed data, and the strategy can be effectively countered by anticipating the cycle.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.237,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper, and considering their last play was rock, it is likely that their next play will be paper. This follows the observed pattern where they tend to play paper after rock or a reset.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response:

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and previous hypothesis:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has played paper 7 times, scissors 5 times, and rock 4 times in the last 22 rounds.
   - The sequence of plays doesn't seem entirely random, suggesting a possible pattern or cycle.
   - Notably, paper is played more frequently, especially after rock or a reset, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.

2. **Previous Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis suggested that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper. It also noted a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - The opponent's plays in the last few rounds (scissors, paper, rock, scissors, paper) suggest a continuation of the cycle with a preference for paper.
   - My positive rewards have primarily come from playing scissors, which counters paper effectively.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern where paper is more frequent, possibly indicating a cycle or a bias towards paper.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards paper still holds.

5. **Strategy Implication:**
   - Given the tendency for the opponent to play paper more frequently, playing scissors should continue to yield positive rewards.
   - Monitoring for any deviations from this pattern is essential to adjust the strategy if needed.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the observed data, and the strategy of playing scissors when expecting paper is effective.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper, and considering the last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.62613, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's look at the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent's plays in sequence: paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors.
   - This sequence suggests a cyclical pattern of "paper, scissors, rock".

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a strict cycle of "paper, scissors, rock" without deviation.
   - This cycle repeats every three rounds.

3. **Hypothesis Validation**:
   - The previous hypothesis suggested that the opponent cycles through "paper, scissors, rock" with occasional resets to paper.
   - However, based on the interaction history, there is no evidence of resets; the cycle is consistent.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards were obtained when playing rock against paper and scissors against rock.
   - This confirms the cyclical pattern as playing the counter to the expected move yields positive rewards.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely following a static strategy of cycling through "paper, scissors, rock" in a strict sequence.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock in a strict sequence without deviation.',
    'value': 0.9,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock in a strict sequence, and given that their last play was scissors, their next play is likely to be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 6, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 7, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 9, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 10, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 11, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 12, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 13, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 14, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 15, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 16, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 17, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 18, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 19, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 20, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 21, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 22, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 23, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 24, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 25, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 26, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}].
                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3102338130000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3102338130000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3102338130000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their plays:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - The opponent has played paper 9 times, scissors 4 times, and rock 5 times in the first 27 rounds.
   - Paper is the most frequently played move, followed by rock, and then scissors.

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a pattern where paper is played more frequently, especially after a rock or a reset.
   - There is a noticeable cycle of paper, scissors, and rock, but with a higher tendency to play paper.

3. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a cycling pattern with resets to paper. This seems consistent with the observed data.
   - The opponent's strategy might involve a cycle of paper, scissors, rock, with a bias towards playing paper more often.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play paper, I have received a mix of rewards: 3 wins, 3 ties, and 1 loss.
   - When I play rock, I have received 3 wins, 2 losses, and 1 tie.
   - When I play scissors, I have received 3 wins, 1 loss, and 2 ties.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent seems to have a strategy that cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a higher frequency of playing paper.
   - This suggests that playing scissors might be a good counter-strategy since it beats paper and ties with scissors.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.3102338130000001,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering that they played paper in the last round, it is likely that they will continue their cycle. Since they tend to play paper more often after rock or a reset, and given that the last play was paper, the next in their cycle should be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {10: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.5171636691000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - The opponent has played each of the three options (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - There seems to be a pattern where the opponent plays paper more frequently after playing rock or after a reset.

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's sequence often follows a cycle: paper, scissors, rock.
   - After playing rock, the opponent tends to reset to paper.
   - This cycle is occasionally interrupted, but the pattern of playing paper after rock is consistent.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play rock, I have received positive rewards against scissors.
   - When I play paper, I have received positive rewards against rock.
   - When I play scissors, I have received positive rewards against paper.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a cyclic pattern with a tendency to reset to paper after playing rock.
   - This suggests that playing rock after the opponent plays rock could be beneficial, as they are likely to play paper next.
   - Similarly, playing scissors after the opponent plays paper could be advantageous.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely following a cyclic strategy with a preference for playing paper after rock.
   - This can be exploited by predicting their next move based on their current play and countering it accordingly.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.5171636691000001,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper, and given that their last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock. This is because they tend to follow the sequence and after playing scissors, rock is the next in their cycle.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of rock, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                The total interaction history is: [{'round': 0, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 1, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 2, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 3, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 4, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 5, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 6, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 7, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 8, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 9, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 10, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 11, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 12, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 13, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 14, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 15, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 16, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 17, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 18, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 19, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 20, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 21, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 22, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 23, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 24, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 25, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 26, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 27, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 28, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}].
                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {21: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

            You last played: paper

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {21: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - There are patterns where the opponent seems to cycle through the options, but with some variations.
   - The opponent has played paper after rock or a reset, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.

2. **Previous Hypothesis**:
   - The hypothesis suggested that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock, with occasional resets to paper.
   - It also noted a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cycle, but not strictly. There are occasional deviations.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent plays paper more frequently after rock or a reset seems to hold true in several instances.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing paper against rock and scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing rock against paper and scissors against rock.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern with occasional resets, favoring paper after rock or a reset.
   - This pattern can be exploited by predicting the next play based on the cycle and countering it.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the observed data. The opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper, and their tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, I believe their next play will be scissors. This is because they played rock in round 28, and based on their cycle, scissors is likely next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict my opponent will play scissors next, my best counter would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {21: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has played each of the three options (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - There seems to be a pattern where paper is played more frequently after rock or a reset.
   - The opponent has played paper 10 times, scissors 6 times, and rock 4 times in the last 30 rounds.

2. **Previous Hypothesis:**
   - The hypothesis suggests that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper.
   - The opponent tends to play paper more frequently after playing rock or after a reset.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - The opponent's last play was paper, which aligns with the hypothesis that paper is played more frequently.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve a cycle with a bias towards paper.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Playing rock has resulted in negative rewards when the opponent plays paper.
   - Playing scissors has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays paper.
   - Playing paper has resulted in mixed rewards, but positive when the opponent plays rock.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent is likely following a strategy that cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.
   - This strategy can be exploited by playing scissors more often, as it counters paper effectively.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with previous observations. The opponent's strategy involves cycling through the options with a tendency to play paper more frequently.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.51,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering that they played paper in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be scissors. This follows their pattern of playing scissors after paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {21: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {21: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history step by step:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - The opponent's plays in the first few rounds were: paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, etc.
   - This suggests a potential cyclic pattern of "paper, scissors, rock."

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cycle of "paper, scissors, rock" with occasional resets to paper.
   - This cycle is evident in rounds 0-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-14, 15-17, 18-20, 21-23, 24-26, 27-29, and 30.

3. **Frequency of Plays**:
   - The opponent tends to play paper more frequently after a reset or after playing rock, which aligns with the hypothesis of a cycle with resets.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play rock, I often receive a positive reward, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - This suggests that predicting the opponent's next play as scissors after paper can be beneficial.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent is likely cycling through "paper, scissors, rock" with occasional resets to paper.
   - The cycle is consistent, and the opponent does not seem to adapt based on my plays.

6. **Strategy Implication**:
   - To exploit this pattern, I should continue playing rock when I predict the opponent will play scissors, which is often after they play paper.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, and given that their last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {22: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles with a preference for rock, occasionally switching to paper or scissors. Rock is played more frequently, with paper often following a sequence of rock plays.', 'value': 0.4, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {22: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down their play pattern based on the interaction history:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent has played each of the three options (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - There seems to be a pattern where the opponent cycles through the plays, but with some variability.

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - **Paper**: Played in rounds 0, 6, 12, 13, 26, 29.
   - **Scissors**: Played in rounds 1, 7, 17, 33.
   - **Rock**: Played in rounds 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 27, 28, 30, 31, 32.

3. **Frequency and Sequence**:
   - The opponent seems to play rock more frequently than paper or scissors.
   - There is a tendency to play paper after a sequence of rock plays, suggesting a possible cycle or reset behavior.
   - Scissors appear less frequently and often follow paper or rock.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent may be cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a higher frequency of rock.
   - After playing rock multiple times, they might switch to paper or scissors, indicating a reset or cycle change.
   - The previous hypothesis about cycling with resets to paper seems partially correct, but rock is more dominant.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing rock against paper and scissors against rock.
   - This suggests that the opponent's strategy can be countered by playing paper more frequently, especially after observing a sequence of rock plays.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to involve a cycle with a preference for rock, occasionally switching to paper or scissors. The strategy can be countered by playing paper more frequently, especially when rock is expected.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles with a preference for rock, occasionally switching to paper or scissors. Rock is played more frequently, with paper often following a sequence of rock plays.',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling with a preference for rock, and the fact that they played rock in the last round, it is likely that they will continue with rock or switch to paper. Given the pattern observed, rock is the more frequent choice after a sequence involving rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {22: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and look for patterns:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent has played each option multiple times, but there seems to be a higher frequency of certain plays.
   - The opponent's plays in sequence: paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, paper.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent seems to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock.
   - There is a noticeable tendency to play paper after a reset or after playing rock.
   - The opponent has played paper more frequently than the other options.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards were obtained when I played paper against rock and scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards occurred when I played rock against paper and scissors against rock.
   - Ties occurred when both played the same option.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic pattern with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.
   - The pattern might be: paper, scissors, rock, with occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.

5. **Strategy Implication:**
   - To exploit this pattern, I should play scissors more frequently, especially after observing a rock or a reset to paper from the opponent.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.53,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock or a reset, and considering that the last play was paper, it is likely that the opponent will continue their cycle. Since they played paper last, the next logical play in their cycle would be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {22: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {22: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine my opponent's likely strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock.
   - There are occasional resets to paper, and paper appears more frequently after rock or a reset.

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's sequence often follows a pattern of paper, scissors, rock. This pattern is evident in several rounds.
   - After playing rock, the opponent tends to reset to paper, which aligns with the earlier hypothesis.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play rock, I often receive a positive reward, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - Playing paper also yields positive rewards when the opponent plays rock.
   - Scissors have been effective against the opponent's paper plays.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic strategy with a sequence of paper, scissors, rock, and resets to paper after rock.
   - This pattern is consistent with the previous hypothesis and the observed data.

5. **Strategy Implication**:
   - To exploit this pattern, I should continue playing rock when expecting scissors, paper when expecting rock, and scissors when expecting paper.
   - Given the cyclic nature, predicting the next move based on the current pattern can maximize rewards.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock, following the cycle.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, and considering their last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors, following their cycle pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper, and considering the last play was paper, it is likely that the opponent will continue the cycle and play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.9861587127989999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper, and given that they played scissors in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.995252438490057, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper, and considering that they played scissors in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be rock, as they tend to follow the cycle after playing scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.9983715864020896, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper, and considering that they played scissors last, it is likely that their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be to play scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {22: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.39886011048146264, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python

                }

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {22: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.39886011048146264, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper. They tended to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Paper**: The opponent played paper in rounds 6, 12, 26, 34, and 51. These instances often followed a sequence where paper was played after rock or scissors.
   - **Scissors**: The opponent played scissors in rounds 7, 17, 33, and 51. This suggests a pattern where scissors often follow paper.
   - **Rock**: The opponent played rock in rounds 2, 5, 8, 11, 18, 23, 28, 31, 36, 39, 42, 45, and 48. Rock seems to appear after scissors or paper, but not consistently.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cycle of paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper.
   - The cycle is not strict, but there is a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a non-adaptive cycle with a preference for paper after certain plays.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are often achieved when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing rock against paper and scissors against rock.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic strategy with a preference for paper after rock or a reset.
   - This strategy is not highly adaptive, allowing for exploitation by predicting the next play based on the cycle.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.39886011048146264,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper, and considering the last play was scissors (a tie), it is likely that the opponent will continue their cycle. Given the pattern, the opponent is likely to play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my best move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {27: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {27: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent has played a mix of rock, paper, and scissors.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

2. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing paper more often.
   - The hypothesis at round 27 suggested a cycle with a bias towards paper, predicting the next play as scissors.

3. **Recent Plays**:
   - From rounds 48 to 52, the opponent played rock, paper, paper, scissors, and rock.
   - This sequence supports the hypothesis of cycling through the choices with a bias towards paper, as paper was played twice consecutively.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I played rock, I received positive rewards against scissors and negative rewards against paper.
   - When I played scissors, I received positive rewards against paper and negative rewards against rock.
   - When I played paper, I received positive rewards against rock and negative rewards against scissors.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cycle of rock, paper, scissors, with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.
   - This bias towards paper suggests that playing scissors might yield more positive rewards, as it counters paper effectively.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely cycling through rock, paper, and scissors, with a tendency to play paper more often.
   - To counter this, I should consider playing scissors more frequently, especially after observing a pattern that suggests paper might be next.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering they just played rock, it is likely they will follow their cycle and play paper next. This is consistent with their tendency to play paper more often after rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            You last played: scissors

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {27: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and identify patterns:

1. **Frequency of Plays**: The opponent seems to have a tendency to play paper more frequently. This is evident from the rounds where I played rock and lost (rounds 9, 13, 29).

2. **Pattern Recognition**: The opponent's plays appear to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, but with a noticeable bias towards paper. This is supported by the fact that I have won multiple times by playing scissors against their paper (rounds 14, 16, 21, 24, 32, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 53).

3. **Response to My Plays**: The opponent does not seem to adapt to my plays dynamically. They continue to play paper frequently even after losing to scissors multiple times.

4. **Static Strategy**: Given the consistent pattern of playing paper more often, it suggests a static strategy rather than an adaptive one. This allows me to exploit their bias by playing scissors more frequently.

5. **Reward Analysis**: Playing scissors has yielded positive rewards consistently when the opponent plays paper. This reinforces the hypothesis that the opponent favors paper.

Based on the above analysis, my hypothesis is that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. This strategy does not seem to adapt based on my plays, allowing me to exploit it by playing scissors more often.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering they just played paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {27: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {27: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and look for patterns:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent's plays seem to cycle through rock, paper, and scissors.
   - There is a noticeable bias towards playing paper more frequently.

2. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent has played paper 11 times, rock 8 times, and scissors 8 times in the rounds provided.
   - The opponent tends to play paper after playing rock or after a reset.
   - The opponent's plays do not seem to adapt to my strategy, indicating a static or cyclic pattern.

3. **Reward Analysis:**
   - I have received positive rewards when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play rock against paper and scissors against rock.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent's strategy appears to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards paper.
   - This bias towards paper suggests that playing rock more frequently could be advantageous, as rock beats scissors and ties with rock, while losing to paper.

5. **Strategy Adjustment:**
   - Given the opponent's tendency to play paper more often, I should consider playing rock more frequently to exploit this pattern.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
        'my_next_play': 'rock'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock, following the cycle pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.7599, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering that they played rock in the last round, it is likely that they will play paper next. This is because their pattern suggests a tendency to play paper more often after rock or a reset.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent will play paper next, my optimal counter move should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.9176457, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering the last play was rock, it is likely that the opponent will play paper next. This is consistent with their tendency to play paper more often after rock or a reset.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.9717524751, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering that they played rock in the last round, it is likely that they will play paper next. This is consistent with their tendency to play paper more often after rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be to play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {27: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.38615871279900005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 14, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 15, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 16, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 17, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 18, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 19, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 20, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 21, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 22, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 23, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 24, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 25, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 26, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 27, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 28, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 29, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 30, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 31, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 32, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 33, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 34, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 35, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 36, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 37, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 38, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 39, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 40, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 41, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 42, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 43, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 44, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 45, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 46, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 47, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 48, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 49, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 50, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 51, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 52, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 53, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 54, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 55, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 56, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 57, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 58, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 59, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 60, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 61, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 62, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 63, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}].
            You last played: scissors

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {27: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.38615871279900005, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. They tend to play paper more often after rock or a reset.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins**: I've won consistently when playing scissors against paper, rock against scissors, and paper against rock.
   - **Losses**: I've lost when playing scissors against rock and rock against paper.
   - **Ties**: Ties have occurred when both played the same move, such as scissors vs. scissors.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cycle with a noticeable frequency of paper. This aligns with the previous hypothesis.
   - The opponent has played paper after rock or a reset, supporting the idea of a bias towards paper.

4. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclic pattern with a bias towards paper, especially after playing rock.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent plays paper more frequently is supported by the consistent wins when I play scissors.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play scissors against paper and rock against scissors.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play scissors against rock and rock against paper.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic strategy with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock. This strategy can be exploited by playing scissors more often, particularly after observing the opponent play rock.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit the opponent's bias towards paper by playing scissors more frequently, especially after the opponent plays rock.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock, and considering the last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock to counter scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. They tend to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays in the recent rounds (15 to 64) show a pattern where they often play rock after paper, and paper after rock.
   - The opponent's play sequence includes several instances where they play rock after paper and paper after rock, which aligns with the hypothesis of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock.
   - The opponent's play does not seem to adapt to my strategy, indicating a static or semi-static strategy.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have received positive rewards when playing paper against rock and rock against scissors.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play scissors against rock, indicating that the opponent plays rock frequently enough to exploit my scissors play.

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's play pattern suggests a cycle with a tendency to play rock after paper and paper after rock.
   - There are occasional resets to paper, which might be a part of their cycle or a random reset.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cycle of paper, scissors, rock, with a higher frequency of playing rock after paper and paper after rock.
   - The hypothesis from round 28 still holds, with the opponent's strategy being a predictable cycle with occasional resets.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play rock after paper and paper after rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play rock after paper, I predict their next play will be rock.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {28: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent has played a mix of paper, scissors, and rock.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where paper appears frequently, especially after certain plays.

2. **Previous Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper.
   - Paper is played more frequently after rock or a reset.

3. **Current Interaction History**:
   - Recent plays show a pattern of paper being played more frequently, especially after ties or wins with rock.
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cycle but with a bias towards paper.

4. **Analysis**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve cycling through the three options but with a higher probability of playing paper.
   - The pattern of playing paper after a reset or after rock suggests a tendency to favor paper in certain situations.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play scissors, I often receive positive rewards, indicating that the opponent frequently plays paper.
   - This supports the hypothesis that the opponent favors paper more than the other options.

6. **Refined Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclical strategy with a bias towards paper, especially after playing rock or after a tie.
   - This strategy can be exploited by playing scissors more frequently, as it counters paper effectively.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to monitor the opponent's plays to confirm this hypothesis and adjust my strategy accordingly.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards paper, especially after rock or ties. Tends to play paper more frequently, which can be countered by playing scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards paper, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing paper, it is likely that the opponent will follow their cycle and play scissors next.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {30: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. They tend to play paper after rock or a reset.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - **Round 66**: I played rock, and the opponent played paper, resulting in a loss for me.
   - **Rounds 17-66**: There are several instances where I played rock and won against scissors, but lost against paper. This suggests that the opponent does play paper frequently, supporting the previous hypothesis.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play paper after I play rock, which aligns with the hypothesis that they have a bias towards paper.
   - The opponent's plays do not seem entirely random, as there is a noticeable pattern of playing paper after certain plays.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have been getting positive rewards when playing paper against their rock and scissors, but negative rewards when playing rock against their paper.
   - This suggests that the opponent's strategy might be predictable enough to exploit by playing paper more frequently.

5. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic pattern with a bias towards paper, especially after I play rock. This pattern can be exploited by playing paper more often, as it counters both rock and paper effectively.

In conclusion, the opponent's strategy seems to involve cycling through the choices with a bias towards paper, especially after I play rock. This aligns with the previous hypothesis and can be exploited by playing paper more frequently.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after opponent plays rock.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after I play rock, I predict their next play will be scissors. This is because they tend to follow the cycle and have just played paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors next, my best counter-move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {30: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {30: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To understand the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - From rounds 18 to 67, I have predominantly received positive rewards when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - There are instances where I lost when playing rock against paper (rounds 29, 66) and scissors against rock (rounds 33, 52).
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play rock and paper more frequently, as I have won multiple times with paper against rock and rock against scissors.

2. **Previous Hypothesis**:
   - The previous hypothesis suggested that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. This is supported by the fact that I have won multiple times with paper against rock and lost when playing rock against paper.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a pattern where paper is played more frequently, especially after a rock or a reset.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards paper seems to hold, as I have been able to exploit this by playing rock and paper effectively.

4. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - Given the consistent positive rewards when playing rock and paper, it suggests that the opponent might be using a static strategy with a bias towards paper.
   - The hypothesis remains valid, and I should continue to exploit this by playing rock more frequently to counter the expected scissors and paper plays.

In conclusion, the opponent appears to be following a predictable pattern with a bias towards playing paper. This allows me to exploit their strategy by playing rock more often.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper after rock or a reset.'

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering that they played scissors in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter would be to play scissors.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {30: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

            You last played: scissors

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {30: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. This hypothesis predicted the opponent would play rock next, and suggested playing paper as a counter.

2. **Recent Plays**: 
   - Round 66: Opponent played paper against my rock (I lost).
   - Round 67: Opponent played scissors against my rock (I won).
   - Round 68: Opponent played rock against my scissors (I lost).

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent played paper, scissors, and rock in the last three rounds, which aligns with the cycling pattern observed earlier.
   - The opponent's play sequence in the last three rounds (paper, scissors, rock) suggests a continuation of the cycle.

4. **Bias Towards Paper**: The opponent has shown a tendency to play paper after rock or a reset, which is consistent with the previous hypothesis.

5. **Static or Adaptive Strategy**: The opponent seems to follow a static cycling strategy rather than adapting to my plays, as the cycle pattern persists.

6. **Reward Analysis**: 
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing rock against scissors.
   - Negative rewards were obtained when playing rock against paper and scissors against rock.

**Conclusion**: The opponent appears to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. This pattern has been consistent, and the hypothesis remains valid.

**Strategy**: To counter this, I should anticipate the next play in the cycle and choose the counter move accordingly.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper after rock or a reset.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering they played rock in the last round, I predict their next play will likely be paper.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter would be to play scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {35: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and look for patterns:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent has played a mix of rock, paper, and scissors.
   - There are instances of ties, losses, and wins, indicating variability in their strategy.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent seems to cycle through rock, paper, and scissors, but with a noticeable bias towards certain plays.
   - For example, after playing rock, the opponent often follows with paper or scissors.
   - There are multiple instances where the opponent played paper after playing rock (e.g., rounds 28, 39, 50, 61).
   - The opponent has also played scissors after paper (e.g., rounds 24, 37, 49, 62).

3. **Bias Detection:**
   - The opponent seems to have a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.
   - This is evident from the repeated pattern of playing paper after rock and the number of times paper appears in the sequence.

4. **Static Strategy or Adaptive?**
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be more static than adaptive, as there is no clear indication that they are countering my plays directly.
   - The pattern of cycling through the choices with a bias towards paper suggests a predetermined sequence rather than an adaptive strategy.

5. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing rock against paper and scissors against rock.
   - Ties occur when both play the same choice.

6. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - Based on the observed patterns, the opponent is likely cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.
   - This bias towards paper can be exploited by playing scissors more often, especially after the opponent plays rock.

**Conclusion:**
The opponent's strategy is likely a cyclic pattern with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. This can be countered by playing scissors more often, especially after the opponent plays rock.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
        'my_next_play': 'scissors'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently after playing rock, and considering the last play was scissors (which resulted in a tie), it is likely that the opponent will continue their cycle and play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be to play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {35: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {35: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock.
   - There is a noted bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock or a reset.

2. **Recent Rounds Analysis**:
   - Round 68: Opponent played rock.
   - Round 69: Opponent played scissors.
   - Round 70: Opponent played rock.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's plays in the last few rounds suggest a pattern of alternating between rock and scissors.
   - The opponent played rock in rounds 68 and 70, with scissors in between (round 69).

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a cycle with a bias towards paper. However, recent rounds show a potential shift or temporary pattern focusing on rock and scissors.
   - The opponent might be alternating between rock and scissors, possibly preparing to play paper next.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Negative rewards were received when playing scissors against rock (rounds 68 and 70).
   - Positive rewards were received when playing rock against scissors (e.g., rounds 22, 30, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 54, 57, 60, 67).

6. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - Given the recent pattern of alternating between rock and scissors, the opponent might play paper next.
   - To counter this, playing scissors could be advantageous if the opponent indeed plays paper.

Based on the above analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to involve alternating between rock and scissors, with a potential upcoming play of paper. This suggests a temporary deviation from the previously observed cycle.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Alternates between rock and scissors, with a potential play of paper next.',
    'value': 0.65,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, which suggests they alternate between rock and scissors with a potential play of paper next, and considering their last play was rock, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely next play is scissors, my best counter move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {53: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Observing the opponent's pattern, they often switch to a move that beats my last play. After I played rock and won, they might switch to paper to counter my rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent might play paper, I should play scissors to counter their paper.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {54: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Observing the recent pattern, the opponent has played 'rock' multiple times when I played 'scissors'. This suggests a tendency to counter 'scissors' with 'rock'. Given this pattern, I predict their next play will likely be 'rock' again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock', my best play would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {54: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {54: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Tends to play paper more often after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. This hypothesis was made at round 54, and it predicted that the opponent would play paper next, suggesting I play scissors.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Paper Frequency**: The opponent has played paper 11 times in the recorded rounds (24 to 73). This includes rounds 26, 28, 31, 34, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 53, 65, and 73.
   - **Scissors Frequency**: The opponent has played scissors 9 times in the same period. This includes rounds 25, 30, 33, 35, 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 52, 56, 59, 62, and 69.
   - **Rock Frequency**: The opponent has played rock 7 times. This includes rounds 29, 32, 37, 40, 43, 46, 49, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 68, 70, and 72.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to have a higher tendency to play paper, especially after playing rock or after a tie.
   - The opponent's plays do not strictly follow a predictable cycle but show a bias towards paper.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent plays paper more frequently is supported by the data, as paper is the most frequent play.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play rock against paper.
   - Ties occur when both play the same move.

5. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - Given the frequency of paper, the opponent's strategy likely involves playing paper more often, possibly in response to certain triggers like a tie or after playing rock.
   - The previous hypothesis about cycling with a bias towards paper still holds, but the cycle is not strict.

**Conclusion**: The opponent's strategy involves a bias towards playing paper, with occasional plays of scissors and rock. This suggests a non-strict cycle with a preference for paper.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Bias towards playing paper more frequently, with occasional plays of scissors and rock. Non-strict cycle with a preference for paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's bias towards playing paper more frequently, with occasional plays of scissors and rock, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing paper, it is likely that the opponent might continue with paper or switch to scissors to counter my paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper or scissors, I should play scissors. Scissors will beat paper if they continue with it, and it will tie if they switch to scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {64: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently, especially after I play scissors.', 'value': 0.4, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {64: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent's plays seem to cycle through rock, paper, and scissors, with a noticeable bias towards playing rock more frequently after playing scissors.
   - My previous hypothesis suggested a cycle with a bias towards paper, but recent rounds show a stronger inclination towards rock.

2. **Recent Interaction Analysis:**
   - From rounds 66 to 74, the opponent played rock 5 times, paper 2 times, and scissors 2 times.
   - Notably, after I played scissors, the opponent played rock in rounds 68, 70, 72, and 74, resulting in negative rewards for me.

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent seems to counter my scissors with rock frequently, indicating a possible pattern of playing rock after I play scissors.
   - There is a potential cycle of rock, paper, scissors, but with a higher frequency of rock, especially following my scissors plays.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent's strategy might involve a cycle with a bias towards rock, particularly after I play scissors.
   - This suggests a pattern where the opponent anticipates my scissors and counters with rock.

5. **Strategy Implications:**
   - To counter this, I should avoid playing scissors immediately after the opponent plays rock, as they are likely to play rock again.
   - Playing paper more frequently could exploit their bias towards rock.

Based on these observations, here is the refined hypothesis:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently, especially after I play scissors.',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
        'my_next_play': 'paper'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently, especially after I play scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock. This is supported by the recent history where they have played rock after I played scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {64: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: 
   - The opponent has played 'paper' frequently, especially after playing 'rock'. 
   - There are several instances where the opponent played 'paper' consecutively or after playing 'rock'. 
   - The opponent has also played 'scissors' and 'rock', but 'paper' appears more frequently.

2. **Recent Plays**:
   - In the last few rounds (71-75), the opponent played: 'scissors', 'rock', 'paper', 'rock', 'paper'.
   - This sequence suggests a potential cycle or bias towards 'paper' after 'rock'.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when I played 'rock' against 'scissors', 'paper' against 'rock', and 'scissors' against 'paper'.
   - Negative rewards occurred when I played 'rock' against 'paper', 'scissors' against 'rock', and 'paper' against 'scissors'.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a cycle with a bias towards 'paper', especially after 'rock'.
   - This hypothesis still holds as the opponent frequently plays 'paper' and occasionally cycles through 'scissors' and 'rock'.

5. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - Given the bias towards 'paper', playing 'scissors' could be advantageous.
   - However, since the opponent also plays 'rock' and 'scissors', I should be cautious and adapt if the pattern changes.

**Conclusion**: The opponent likely cycles through 'paper', 'scissors', and 'rock', with a noticeable bias towards 'paper', especially after playing 'rock'. This pattern can be exploited by playing 'scissors' more frequently, but I should remain adaptable.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.',
    'value': 0.51,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock, I observe that the opponent played paper in the last round. Given this pattern, it is likely that the opponent will continue the cycle and play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {64: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Analyzing the interaction history, the opponent seems to have a tendency to play rock after losing with scissors. Given that they just lost with scissors, it is likely they will play rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be to play paper.

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.7599, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.7599, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock, and considering their last play was rock, it is likely that their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.8319300000000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock, and considering their last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors, following their cycle pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {64: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.31764570000000003, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {64: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.31764570000000003, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - The opponent has played rock frequently in the recent rounds (rounds 68, 70, 72, 74, and 80).
   - There is a pattern where the opponent plays rock after playing scissors or paper, but this is not consistent enough to form a definitive cycle.
   - The opponent has played paper less frequently in the recent rounds, which contradicts the previous hypothesis of a bias towards paper.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards were obtained when playing scissors against rock, indicating the opponent's frequent use of rock.

4. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to favor rock more frequently in the recent rounds, especially after playing scissors.
   - There is no clear cycle of paper, scissors, rock as previously hypothesized.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent might have shifted to a strategy that favors rock more frequently, possibly to counter my previous plays of scissors.
   - The opponent's strategy might not be a strict cycle but rather a tendency to play rock more often, especially after playing scissors.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is refined as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Favors rock more frequently, especially after playing scissors. Less emphasis on cycling through paper, scissors, rock.',
    'value': 0.45,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's tendency to favor rock more frequently, especially after playing scissors, and considering that I played scissors in the last round, it is likely that the opponent will play rock again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {64: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.52235199, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {64: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.52235199, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's look at the interaction history and the previous hypothesis:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Paper**: The opponent has played paper multiple times, resulting in ties when I played paper and wins for me when I played scissors.
   - **Scissors**: The opponent has played scissors less frequently, and I have won against it with rock.
   - **Rock**: The opponent has played rock, and I have won against it with paper.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to play paper quite frequently, as evidenced by the number of ties and my wins with scissors.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays rock, and I have countered it successfully with paper.
   - Scissors appear less frequently, and I have countered it with rock.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have received positive rewards when playing scissors against paper and rock against scissors.
   - I have received negative rewards when playing scissors against rock.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a pattern of playing paper more frequently, with occasional switches to rock and scissors.
   - The bias towards paper is evident from the number of ties and wins with scissors.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to involve playing paper more often, with occasional plays of rock and scissors. This aligns with the previous hypothesis of cycling through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards paper.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock, and considering their last play was paper, I predict their next play will likely be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {64: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.665646393, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {64: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.665646393, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - The opponent has played a mix of rock, paper, and scissors.
   - There seems to be a pattern where the opponent plays paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - From rounds 33 to 82, the opponent has shown a tendency to play rock followed by paper or scissors.
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a cycle of paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing scissors against rock and rock against paper.
   - Neutral outcomes occur when both players choose the same option.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a noticeable bias towards playing paper after rock.
   - This bias towards paper is evident as playing rock has frequently resulted in positive rewards.

5. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - Given the opponent's tendency to play paper more often, especially after rock, playing scissors could be a beneficial counter-strategy.
   - However, since playing rock has yielded positive rewards against scissors, maintaining a strategy of playing rock could continue to be advantageous.

In conclusion, the opponent's strategy appears to involve cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. This pattern can be exploited by playing rock more often, as it counters both scissors and paper effectively.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock, and considering that they just played scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock, I anticipate that their next play will be scissors. This is because they played rock in the last round, and they tend to follow rock with scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {67: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after opponent plays rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {67: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after opponent plays rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - From rounds 35 to 50, I consistently won by cycling through rock, paper, and scissors. This suggests that my opponent might have been playing a predictable pattern or a static strategy that I was able to exploit.
   - Starting from round 51, there are instances where I tied or lost, indicating a potential change or adaptation in my opponent's strategy.

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - My opponent's plays in the recent rounds (66 to 84) show a mix of rock, paper, and scissors, with a noticeable frequency of paper when I played rock.
   - The previous hypothesis suggested that my opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after I play rock.

3. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The hypothesis that my opponent cycles through the three options with a bias towards paper seems consistent with the recent rounds. For instance, in round 84, my opponent played paper when I played rock, resulting in a loss for me.
   - The hypothesis also predicted that after I play rock, my opponent is likely to play scissors next, which aligns with the observed pattern.

4. **Strategy Evaluation**:
   - When I play rock, I have mixed results: winning against scissors, losing against paper, and tying against rock.
   - The hypothesis that my opponent has a bias towards paper, especially after I play rock, is supported by the recent interaction history.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - My opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after I play rock. This suggests that I should consider playing scissors more often to counteract their bias towards paper.

Based on this analysis, my refined hypothesis is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after opponent plays rock.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after I play rock, I believe their next play will be scissors. This is because they played paper in the last round, and based on their cycle pattern, scissors is likely to follow.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {67: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after opponent plays rock.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - From rounds 36 to 50, I consistently won by cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, suggesting the opponent was playing a predictable pattern.
   - From rounds 51 to 85, there were fluctuations in outcomes, indicating a potential change or variation in the opponent's strategy.

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The previous hypothesis suggested the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after I play rock.
   - Observing the interaction history, there is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays rock after I play scissors, which leads to my losses in rounds 52, 68, 70, 72, and 80.
   - The opponent seems to play paper after I play rock, as seen in rounds 66 and 84, where I lost.

3. **Current Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent might be cycling through rock, paper, and scissors but with a bias towards playing rock after I play scissors and paper after I play rock.
   - This suggests a pattern where the opponent tries to counter my previous move, possibly indicating a reactive strategy rather than a static one.

4. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - Given the observed pattern, I should consider playing the counter to the opponent's expected next move based on their bias.
   - If the opponent plays rock after I play scissors, I should play paper after playing scissors.
   - If the opponent plays paper after I play rock, I should play scissors after playing rock.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have been getting positive rewards when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play scissors against rock and rock against paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing rock after opponent plays scissors and paper after opponent plays rock.',
    'value': 0.55,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock' if my_last_play == 'scissors' else 'paper',
        'my_next_play': 'paper' if my_last_play == 'scissors' else 'scissors'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Observing the opponent's recent plays, they have shown a tendency to play scissors after I play rock. Given that my last play was rock, I predict their next play will likely be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {71: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Alternates between rock and scissors, with a potential play of paper next.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {71: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Alternates between rock and scissors, with a potential play of paper next.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and look for patterns:

1. **Winning Streaks and Patterns**: 
   - From rounds 37 to 50, I had a consistent winning streak using a sequence of scissors, rock, paper. This suggests that during this period, the opponent was consistently playing paper, scissors, rock in some order, which I countered effectively.
   
2. **Recent Patterns**:
   - In the recent rounds (81 to 86), the opponent played paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock. 
   - There seems to be a pattern where the opponent plays rock more frequently, especially in the last few rounds.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Previous hypothesis suggested alternating between rock and scissors with a potential play of paper. However, the recent plays do not fully align with this hypothesis since there are more occurrences of rock and paper.
   - The opponent might be favoring rock more often, with occasional plays of paper and scissors.

4. **Static Strategy Consideration**:
   - If the opponent is playing a static strategy, it might involve a higher frequency of rock, with occasional paper and scissors to mix it up.
   - My recent plays of rock have resulted in ties or wins, suggesting that the opponent might be playing rock frequently.

5. **Counter Strategy**:
   - Given the tendency of the opponent to play rock more often, a counter strategy would be to play paper more frequently to exploit this pattern.

**Conclusion**: The opponent seems to favor rock, with occasional plays of paper and scissors. Playing paper more often could exploit this tendency.

```python
{

```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to favor rock with occasional paper and scissors, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing rock, it is likely that the opponent will continue with rock in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be to play paper, as it beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {76: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis (Round 76):** The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock. The predicted next play was scissors, and the suggested counter was rock.

2. **Recent Interaction History:**
   - **Rounds 38-50:** The opponent consistently played in a pattern that allowed me to win by cycling through rock, paper, and scissors.
   - **Rounds 51-87:** There are more ties and losses, indicating a potential shift or adaptation in the opponent's strategy. Notably, there are several instances where the opponent played paper, leading to ties or losses when I played rock.

3. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - **Bias Towards Paper:** There are multiple instances where the opponent played paper, resulting in ties when I also played paper (rounds 65, 73, 75, 81, 87).
   - **Losses with Scissors:** When I played scissors, I often lost to rock (rounds 52, 68, 70, 72, 74, 80).
   - **Wins with Rock:** Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent played scissors (rounds 38, 41, 44, 47, 50, 54, 57, 60, 67, 71, 76, 79, 82, 85).

4. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent seems to have a bias towards playing paper, especially after playing rock or scissors. This is evident from the frequent ties when I played paper.
   - The opponent might be cycling through rock, paper, and scissors but with a higher frequency of playing paper.

5. **Strategy Suggestion:**
   - Given the bias towards paper, playing scissors could be a more effective counter-strategy. However, since playing rock has yielded positive rewards, it might be beneficial to continue with rock, especially if the opponent's next play is predicted to be scissors or paper.

In summary, the opponent's strategy seems to involve a cycle with a bias towards paper. This can be exploited by playing scissors more frequently, but maintaining a balance with rock due to its past success.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering the last play was paper, it is likely that they will continue the cycle. Therefore, their next play is predicted to be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after a loss or tie.', 'value': 0.55, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {76: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To understand the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and the previous hypothesis:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was hypothesized to cycle through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock. The predicted next play was scissors, and my counter was rock.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 39 to 50, I consistently won by playing paper, scissors, and rock in sequence, suggesting the opponent was playing rock, paper, and scissors in a predictable pattern.
   - From rounds 51 to 53, I encountered a tie and a loss, indicating a possible change or variation in the opponent's pattern.
   - From rounds 54 to 60, I won consistently again, suggesting the opponent reverted to a predictable pattern.
   - From rounds 61 to 70, I experienced a mix of wins, ties, and losses, indicating some variability or adaptation in the opponent's strategy.
   - From rounds 71 to 88, I had a mix of outcomes, but with a notable number of wins when playing rock.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play rock after a few rounds of variability, as evidenced by my wins when playing paper and rock.
   - The opponent's strategy might involve a cycle with occasional deviations, possibly influenced by my previous plays.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent might be cycling through rock, paper, and scissors but with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after a loss or tie.
   - The opponent's deviations might be attempts to counter my previous successful plays.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have been getting positive rewards when playing rock, suggesting the opponent plays scissors or has a bias towards rock.

**Conclusion**: The opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern with a bias towards playing rock more frequently, especially after a loss or tie. This pattern can be exploited by playing paper more often to counter their rock bias.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after a loss or tie.',
    'value': 0.55,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after a loss or tie, and considering that they lost the last round when I played rock, it is likely they will play rock next to try and counter my previous successful play.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {76: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {76: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - From rounds 40 to 50, I consistently won by cycling through scissors, rock, and paper, which suggests the opponent was playing a predictable pattern.
   - There was a period of mixed results from rounds 51 to 75, with some losses and ties, indicating a possible change or adaptation in the opponent's strategy.

2. **Recent Pattern**:
   - From rounds 76 to 89, I have mostly won or tied, with a few losses. The wins were primarily when I played rock or paper.
   - The previous hypothesis suggested the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.

3. **Current Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cyclical pattern but with a noticeable bias towards playing paper after rock. This pattern allows me to predict their next move with some accuracy.
   - My recent wins with rock and paper suggest the opponent might be playing scissors and rock more frequently, respectively.

4. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - Given the opponent's tendency to play paper more often after rock, I should continue playing rock and paper to counter their likely plays of scissors and rock.
   - The hypothesis about their cyclical pattern with a bias towards paper still holds, as it explains the majority of the interaction history.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclical pattern with a bias towards playing paper after rock. This allows me to exploit their pattern by playing rock and paper more frequently.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock, and considering that they played rock in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent will play paper next, my optimal counter-play should be scissors to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock, and considering their last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {76: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.3717524751000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {76: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.3717524751000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To understand the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis:** The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.

2. **Recent Plays Analysis:**
   - **Rounds 47-96:** The opponent's plays include a mix of rock, paper, and scissors. However, there seems to be a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays rock after playing scissors and paper after playing rock.
   - **Bias Towards Paper:** The hypothesis suggested a bias towards paper, which seems consistent with the opponent's frequent losses when I play scissors. However, the opponent also plays rock frequently, especially after playing scissors.

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - **Rock After Scissors:** The opponent tends to play rock after playing scissors, as seen in rounds 52, 68, 70, 80, and 96.
   - **Paper After Rock:** The opponent often plays paper after playing rock, as seen in rounds 48, 55, 61, 64, 89, and 95.

4. **Static Strategy or Adaptation:** The opponent's strategy seems to be a static cycle with a slight bias towards paper, but they also frequently play rock after scissors. This suggests a predictable pattern rather than an adaptive strategy.

5. **Reward Analysis:**
   - **Positive Reward with Scissors:** I receive positive rewards when playing scissors against their paper.
   - **Negative Reward with Scissors:** I receive negative rewards when playing scissors against their rock.

6. **Hypothesis Refinement:** The opponent cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing rock after scissors and paper after rock. This pattern can be exploited by predicting their next move based on their previous play.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing rock after scissors and paper after rock.',
    'value': 0.45,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock' if opponent_last_play == 'scissors' else 'paper',
        'my_next_play': 'paper' if opponent_last_play == 'rock' else 'scissors'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Observing the opponent's recent plays, they have played 'rock' frequently after I played 'scissors'. This suggests a tendency to counter 'scissors' with 'rock'. Therefore, I predict their next play will likely be 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted 'rock' play by the opponent, my best move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {76: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.5602267325700001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock. This hypothesis was based on observations up to round 76.

2. **Recent Plays**: From rounds 48 to 97, the opponent's plays have been recorded. Let's look for patterns:
   - **Paper**: The opponent played paper in rounds 48, 49, 50, 51, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97.
   - **Scissors**: The opponent played scissors in rounds 49, 51, 53, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 75, 77, 78, 80, 82, 84, 86, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96.
   - **Rock**: The opponent played rock in rounds 50, 52, 54, 57, 60, 64, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 76, 79, 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play paper more frequently, as observed in the previous hypothesis.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays paper after playing rock, supporting the previous hypothesis.
   - The opponent's plays do not appear to be purely random, as there is a discernible cycle with a bias towards paper.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I played rock, I often received positive rewards, especially when the opponent played scissors.
   - When I played scissors, I received mixed rewards, indicating that the opponent sometimes counters with rock.
   - When I played paper, I received positive rewards when the opponent played rock, but ties occurred when both played paper.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cycle of paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.
   - This strategy can be exploited by playing scissors more often, as it counters the frequent paper plays.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to monitor the opponent's plays to confirm this pattern and adjust my strategy accordingly.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock, and considering that they played paper in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be scissors, following their cycle pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {82: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''

   - The opponent has played 'rock' in rounds 98, 96, 94, 91, 89, 86, 84, 81, 78, 76, 73, 71, 68, 66, 63, 61, 58, 56, 54, 52, 50, and 49.
   - The opponent has played 'paper' in rounds 97, 95, 93, 92, 90, 87, 85, 83, 80, 79, 77, 75, 74, 72, 70, 69, 67, 65, 64, 62, 60, 59, 57, 55, 53, and 51.
   - The opponent has played 'scissors' in rounds 99, 98, 96, 94, 91, 89, 86, 84, 81, 78, 76, 73, 71, 68, 66, 63, 61, 58, 56, 54, 52, 50, and 49.

2. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to cycle through 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors' with a slight bias towards playing 'rock' more frequently.
   - The opponent tends to play 'rock' after 'scissors', 'paper' after 'rock', and 'scissors' after 'paper', suggesting a cyclic pattern.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play 'rock', I have received positive rewards when the opponent played 'scissors' and ties when they played 'rock'.
   - When I play 'paper', I have received positive rewards when the opponent played 'rock'.
   - When I play 'scissors', I have received positive rewards when the opponent played 'paper'.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclic pattern of 'rock', 'paper', 'scissors', with a slight bias towards 'rock'.
   - This pattern can be exploited by predicting the next move based on the cycle and countering it.

5. **Strategy**:
   - To counter the opponent's cyclic strategy, I should play the move that beats the opponent's next predicted move in the cycle.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',  # Assuming the cycle continues
        'my_next_play': 'scissors'  # To counter the predicted 'paper'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards rock, and considering that the last round ended in a tie with both playing rock, it is likely that the opponent will follow their cycle and play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my best move would be to play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {85: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after opponent plays rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {85: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after opponent plays rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after I play rock.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Rounds 50-99**: 
     - Wins with rock against scissors: 50, 54, 57, 60, 67, 71, 76, 79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94.
     - Wins with paper against rock: 55, 58, 61, 64, 77, 83, 89, 92, 95.
     - Wins with scissors against paper: 53, 56, 59, 62, 78, 90, 93, 99.
     - Losses with scissors against rock: 52, 68, 70, 72, 74, 80, 96.
     - Losses with rock against paper: 66, 84.
     - Ties: 51, 63, 65, 69, 73, 75, 81, 86, 87, 97, 98.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to play scissors after I play rock, leading to my wins when I play rock.
   - The opponent plays rock after I play scissors, leading to my losses when I play scissors.
   - The opponent plays paper after I play rock, leading to my losses when I play rock.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays paper more frequently, especially after I play rock.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent is likely cycling through rock, paper, and scissors but with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after I play rock. This bias towards paper is evident in the rounds where I lose with rock against paper.

5. **Strategy Implication**:
   - To counter this strategy, I should consider playing scissors more frequently, especially after I play rock, to counter the opponent's bias towards paper.

Based on this analysis, here is the refined hypothesis:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after player_0 plays rock.',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after I play rock, and considering that I last played scissors, it is likely that the opponent will continue their cycle and play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {88: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {88: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. This hypothesis was made at round 88 with a prediction that the opponent would play scissors next.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - From rounds 51 to 100, the opponent's plays were: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors.
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a pattern of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors, with a noticeable frequency of paper plays.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays in the last 50 rounds (51-100) show a sequence of rock, paper, and scissors, with paper appearing slightly more frequently.
   - The opponent played paper 17 times, rock 16 times, and scissors 17 times in these rounds, indicating a relatively balanced cycle but with a slight inclination towards paper.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I played rock, I received positive rewards against scissors and negative rewards against paper.
   - When I played paper, I received positive rewards against rock and negative rewards against scissors.
   - When I played scissors, I received positive rewards against paper and negative rewards against rock.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent appears to cycle through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. This aligns with the previous hypothesis and the observed pattern in the interaction history.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be a cyclic pattern with a slight bias towards paper. This can be exploited by playing scissors more frequently to counter the paper plays.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis, the opponent seems to cycle through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. In the last round, they played scissors, which aligns with the prediction. Given this pattern, it is likely that their next play will be rock, as they might continue the cycle.

2. 'my_next_play': If the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter-move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {88: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and see if any patterns emerge:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent seems to have a bias towards playing "rock" and "paper" more frequently, with occasional "scissors."
   - There are sequences where the opponent plays "rock" multiple times in a row, followed by "paper."

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - From rounds 52 to 101, the opponent played "rock" 18 times, "paper" 14 times, and "scissors" 8 times.
   - The opponent often follows a "rock" with "scissors" or "paper," but there is a noticeable bias towards "paper" after "rock."

3. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a cycle with a bias towards "paper." This seems consistent with the observed plays.
   - The opponent might be cycling through "rock," "paper," and "scissors" with a tendency to play "paper" more frequently after "rock."

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - When I played "paper," I received a positive reward against "rock" multiple times.
   - Playing "rock" also yielded positive rewards against "scissors."
   - Playing "scissors" has been less consistent, with both positive and negative rewards.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic pattern with a bias towards "paper" after "rock."
   - Exploiting this pattern by playing "paper" when expecting "rock" and "rock" when expecting "scissors" could be beneficial.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently after rock.',
    'value': 0.51,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
        'my_next_play': 'paper'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently after rock, and considering their last play was rock, it is likely they will play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {89: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after a loss or tie.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {89: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after a loss or tie.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - From rounds 53 to 62, I had a winning streak using a sequence of scissors, rock, and paper, which suggests the opponent was cycling through paper, scissors, and rock.
   - However, after round 62, the pattern became less predictable with ties and losses interspersed.

2. **Previous Hypothesis**:
   - The previous hypothesis suggested the opponent cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after a loss or tie.

3. **Recent Interaction Analysis**:
   - From rounds 63 to 102, there are several ties and losses, indicating the opponent might be adapting or the initial pattern is not consistent.
   - Notably, there are multiple instances where playing rock resulted in a win, suggesting the opponent plays scissors frequently.
   - However, there are also losses when playing rock, indicating the opponent sometimes plays paper.

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play scissors after a loss or tie, as seen in rounds 63, 69, 74, 80, 96, and 102.
   - There are also instances where the opponent plays rock after a tie or loss, as seen in rounds 68, 70, 72, and 74.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent might be cycling through rock, paper, scissors but with a bias towards playing scissors more frequently after a loss or tie.
   - This could explain the frequent wins with rock and the occasional losses when the opponent plays paper.

6. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - Given the tendency to play scissors, playing rock could be a beneficial strategy.
   - However, to counter the occasional paper play, mixing in some scissors might be advantageous.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing scissors more frequently after a loss or tie.',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing scissors more frequently after a loss or tie, and given the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, it is likely that the opponent will play scissors again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.

                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {89: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after a loss or tie.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after a loss or tie. This hypothesis was made at round 89 with a confidence value of 0.51.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - From rounds 54 to 103, the opponent's plays are as follows:
     - Rock: 54, 55, 57, 58, 60, 61, 63, 64, 66, 67, 69, 70, 71, 72, 74, 75, 76, 77, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103
     - Paper: 56, 59, 62, 65, 68, 73, 78
     - Scissors: 55, 58, 61, 64, 67, 70, 72, 75, 77, 80, 83, 86, 89, 92, 95, 98, 101

3. **Observations**:
   - The opponent seems to play rock more frequently, especially after a tie or loss.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent tends to play rock after a tie (rounds 63, 65, 69, 73, 75, 81, 87, 97, 98, 102, 103).
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be somewhat predictable, with a tendency to revert to rock after non-winning rounds.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are often achieved when I play paper, especially after the opponent plays rock.
   - Playing rock has also yielded positive rewards, particularly when the opponent plays scissors.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors, with a bias towards playing rock more frequently, especially after a tie or loss.
   - This strategy can be exploited by playing paper more frequently, particularly after a tie or loss, to counter the opponent's tendency to play rock.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after a loss or tie.',
    'value': 0.55,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after a loss or tie, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing rock, it is likely that the opponent will play rock again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {99: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently. This hypothesis was made at round 99, predicting the opponent would play paper next.

2. **Recent Plays**: 
   - Round 100: Opponent played scissors.
   - Round 101: Opponent played rock.
   - Round 102: Opponent played scissors.
   - Round 103: Opponent played rock.
   - Round 104: Opponent played paper.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - From rounds 100 to 104, the opponent played scissors, rock, scissors, rock, paper.
   - This sequence suggests a potential pattern of alternating between scissors and rock, with an occasional paper.

4. **Bias Towards Rock**: The hypothesis of a bias towards rock seems consistent, as rock appears twice in the last five rounds.

5. **Static Strategy or Cyclic Pattern**: The opponent might be using a cyclic pattern with a bias towards rock, but the inclusion of paper in round 104 suggests they might not be strictly cycling through rock, paper, scissors in order.

6. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when I played rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occurred when I played scissors against rock and paper against scissors.

7. **Conclusion**: The opponent seems to have a pattern with a slight bias towards rock, occasionally playing paper. This suggests a cyclic strategy with a preference for rock.

Based on this analysis, my strategy should focus on countering rock more frequently, while being prepared for occasional paper plays.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles with a bias towards rock, occasionally playing paper.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling with a bias towards rock and occasionally playing paper, and considering the last play was paper, it is likely that the opponent will switch to rock in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {99: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {99: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis (Round 99):** The opponent cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently. The predicted next play was scissors, and my next play was rock.

2. **Recent Interaction History:**
   - **Rounds 56-65:** A mix of wins and ties, with a loss when I played rock against paper.
   - **Rounds 66-75:** Losses when playing rock against paper and scissors against rock, but wins when playing rock against scissors.
   - **Rounds 76-85:** Mostly wins with rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - **Rounds 86-95:** Wins with rock against scissors and paper against rock, but losses with scissors against rock.
   - **Rounds 96-105:** Losses with paper against scissors and scissors against rock, but wins with paper against rock.

3. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - The opponent seems to play rock, paper, and scissors in a somewhat cyclical manner, but with a noticeable frequency of playing rock.
   - Losses often occur when I play paper against scissors or scissors against rock.
   - Wins are frequent when I play rock against scissors and paper against rock.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent might be following a cyclical pattern but with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.
   - This aligns with the previous hypothesis, as the opponent's plays often result in losses for me when I play paper against scissors and scissors against rock.
   - The opponent's strategy might be predictable, allowing me to exploit it by playing rock more often, as it counters both scissors and the frequent rock plays.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve cycling through rock, paper, and scissors, with a slight bias towards rock. This pattern can be exploited by playing rock more frequently, as it counters both scissors and the frequent rock plays.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.',
    'value': 0.51,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
        'my_next_play': 'rock'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards rock, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely they will continue the cycle and play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {99: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {99: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently. This hypothesis was made at round 99.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - From rounds 57 to 106, the opponent's plays were: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, rock, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, rock, paper, rock, rock, paper, rock.
   - Observing the sequence, there seems to be a pattern where rock is played more frequently than paper or scissors.
   - The opponent seems to play rock every few rounds, interspersed with paper and scissors.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when I played paper against rock and rock against scissors.
   - Negative rewards occurred when I played rock against paper and scissors against rock.
   - Ties occurred when both played the same move.

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's plays do not strictly follow a simple cycle of rock, paper, scissors. However, there is a noticeable tendency to play rock more often than the other two options.
   - This aligns with the previous hypothesis that the opponent has a bias towards playing rock.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a non-uniform cycle with a bias towards rock. They might be using a probabilistic approach where rock is chosen more frequently than paper or scissors.

Based on this analysis, my strategy should focus on exploiting the opponent's tendency to play rock by choosing paper more often.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Non-uniform cycle with a bias towards rock, playing rock more frequently than paper or scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of a non-uniform cycle with a bias towards rock, and considering that they played rock in the last round, it is likely they might continue with rock or switch to another move in their cycle. However, given the bias towards rock, I predict their next play will likely be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards rock, and given that the last play was paper, it is likely that the opponent will continue their cycle. Since they played paper last, their next play is likely to be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently, and considering that they played scissors in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently, and given that they played rock in the last round, it is likely that they will continue this cycle. Therefore, their next play is predicted to be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of paper, my best move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {99: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.38022673256999995, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {99: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.38022673256999995, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and see if we can identify any patterns or biases in their play:

1. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played each of the three options (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - There are instances where the opponent played the same move consecutively, such as paper in rounds 65, 73, 75, 81, 87, 97, 104, and 107.
   - The opponent has played rock in rounds 66, 68, 70, 72, 80, 84, 86, 98, 103, and 108.
   - The opponent has played scissors in rounds 67, 69, 74, 76, 78, 82, 88, 90, 92, 94, 96, 99, 102, 105, 110, 112, and 114.

2. **Bias Identification**:
   - There seems to be a slight bias towards playing rock and scissors more frequently than paper.
   - The opponent has played rock and scissors more frequently, with scissors being the most frequent in recent rounds.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I played rock, I often received positive rewards, especially against scissors.
   - When I played paper, I received mixed rewards, but I often lost to scissors.
   - When I played scissors, I received positive rewards against paper but lost to rock.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent might be cycling through rock, paper, and scissors but with a bias towards playing scissors more frequently.
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a bias towards rock, but recent rounds indicate a stronger bias towards scissors.

5. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - Given the bias towards scissors, I should consider playing rock more frequently to exploit this tendency.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing scissors more frequently.',
    'value': 0.45,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing scissors more frequently, and considering the last play was scissors, it is likely that the opponent will continue their cycle. Therefore, their next play is predicted to be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely next play is rock, my best counter would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {99: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.566158712799, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently. This hypothesis was made at round 99.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - From rounds 66 to 115, the opponent's plays are as follows:
     - Rock: 15 times
     - Paper: 12 times
     - Scissors: 9 times
   - The opponent seems to play rock more frequently than paper or scissors, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards were obtained when playing rock against paper and scissors against rock.
   - Neutral rewards were obtained when both players played the same move.

4. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent's plays do not follow a strict cycle but show a tendency to play rock more often.
   - The hypothesis of a slight bias towards rock is supported by the frequency of rock plays.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent likely has a strategy that involves playing rock more frequently than the other options, possibly with some randomization or slight cycling involved.

Given this analysis, the best counter-strategy would be to play paper more frequently, as it counters rock effectively and has been yielding positive rewards.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Plays rock more frequently than paper or scissors, with some randomization or slight cycling involved.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent tends to play rock more frequently, and considering the recent pattern where they played rock after I played paper, I believe their next play will likely be rock again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by my opponent, my best move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {99: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.6963110989593, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {99: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.6963110989593, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - The opponent has played each of the three options (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - There are several instances where the opponent played rock and I countered with paper, resulting in a positive reward for me.
   - Similarly, when the opponent played paper, I often played scissors, which also resulted in positive rewards.
   - There are ties when both of us played the same move, indicating no clear pattern of adaptation from the opponent.

2. **Previous Hypothesis:**
   - The previous hypothesis suggested that the opponent cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.
   - This hypothesis was based on the observation that playing paper against the opponent often resulted in a positive reward, suggesting a tendency for the opponent to play rock.

3. **Current Observations:**
   - Recent rounds show a mix of plays from the opponent, including rock, paper, and scissors, with no clear adaptation to my strategy.
   - The hypothesis of a cycle with a bias towards rock still holds, as playing paper has generally been beneficial.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - Given the consistent positive rewards when playing paper against the opponent, the hypothesis of a cycle with a bias towards rock remains plausible.
   - The opponent does not seem to adapt dynamically to my plays, reinforcing the idea of a static or semi-static strategy.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern with a slight bias towards rock, as evidenced by the positive outcomes when I play paper.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit the opponent's tendency to play rock more frequently by playing paper more often.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards rock, and considering the last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors, following the cycle.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter it effectively.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.78741776927151, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards rock, and given that they played scissors in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be rock, as they tend to cycle and have a bias towards rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {99: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.3270842948601279, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {99: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.3270842948601279, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently. This was based on the observation up to round 99.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 71 to 120, there are several instances where the opponent's play can be observed:
     - Rock: 10 times
     - Paper: 8 times
     - Scissors: 9 times
   - The distribution is relatively balanced, but rock appears slightly more frequently, supporting the previous hypothesis of a bias towards rock.

3. **Performance Against Opponent**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards were obtained when playing scissors against rock and paper against scissors.
   - Ties occurred when both played the same move.

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's plays do not follow a strict cycle but show a slight preference for rock.
   - The hypothesis of cycling with a bias towards rock still holds, as the distribution of plays supports this.

5. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - To counter the opponent's strategy, playing paper more frequently could exploit the bias towards rock.
   - However, maintaining a balance to not become predictable is crucial.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the previous one, with a slight refinement based on recent data.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.',
    'value': 0.3270842948601279,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently, and considering the last play was scissors, it is likely that the opponent will play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. This hypothesis was made at round 101.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 72 to 121, the opponent's plays are as follows:
     - Rock: 6 times (rounds 72, 74, 80, 96, 98, 103)
     - Paper: 11 times (rounds 73, 75, 81, 84, 87, 97, 104, 107, 116, 120, 121)
     - Scissors: 8 times (rounds 76, 78, 79, 82, 85, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 99, 100, 102, 105, 106, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 117, 118, 119)

3. **Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played paper more frequently than rock or scissors, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.
   - The opponent's plays do not appear to follow a strict cycle, but there is a noticeable bias towards paper.
   - When I played rock, I received positive rewards more frequently, suggesting that rock is a good counter to the opponent's strategy.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent seems to have a bias towards playing paper, but they do not strictly cycle through the options.
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, indicating that the opponent's strategy can be countered effectively by playing rock more often.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is that the opponent has a bias towards playing paper, and I should exploit this by playing rock more frequently.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Bias towards playing paper more frequently.',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's bias towards playing paper more frequently and their recent pattern of playing scissors, it is likely they might switch back to paper in the next round to maintain unpredictability.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted play of paper by the opponent, my next play should be scissors, which will beat paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Observing the recent pattern, the opponent has played 'rock' after I played 'scissors' in the last round. This suggests they might continue with 'rock' as it successfully countered my 'scissors'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of 'rock', I should play 'paper', as paper beats rock.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. This hypothesis was made at round 101.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - From round 74 to 123, the opponent has played rock, paper, and scissors multiple times.
   - There are several instances where the opponent played paper consecutively or frequently, which aligns with the previous hypothesis of a bias towards paper.
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a pattern where paper appears more often than rock or scissors.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occurred when playing scissors against rock and paper against scissors.
   - Neutral rewards (ties) happened frequently when both played paper.

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to play paper quite often, as evidenced by the frequent ties when I played paper.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent cycles through the choices with a bias towards paper still holds, given the frequent occurrences of paper in the interaction history.

5. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclic pattern with a bias towards paper, which suggests that playing scissors more often could be advantageous to counter their frequent paper plays.

Based on this analysis, the opponent likely follows a cyclic strategy with a bias towards paper. Therefore, playing scissors more frequently could exploit this pattern.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering the recent pattern, it is likely that their next play will be rock, as they have just played paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            The total interaction history is: [{'round': 77, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 78, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 79, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 80, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 81, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 82, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 83, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 84, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 85, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 86, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 87, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 88, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 89, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 90, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 91, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 92, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 93, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 94, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 95, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 96, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 97, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 98, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 99, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 100, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 101, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 102, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 103, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 104, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 105, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 106, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 107, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 108, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 109, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 110, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 111, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 112, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 113, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 114, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 115, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 116, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 117, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 118, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 119, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 120, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 121, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 122, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 123, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 124, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 125, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 126, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}].
            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.882351, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.882351, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, which suggests they cycle through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently, and given that they played paper in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be rock, following the cycle pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.31764570000000003, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.31764570000000003, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and look for patterns:

1. **Winning Plays**: 
   - I have won with "scissors" against "paper" multiple times (rounds 78, 90, 93, 99, 110, 113, 126).
   - I have won with "rock" against "scissors" multiple times (rounds 79, 82, 85, 88, 91, 94, 108, 111, 117).
   - I have won with "paper" against "rock" multiple times (rounds 83, 89, 92, 95, 101, 106, 109, 112, 115, 118, 125).

2. **Losing Plays**:
   - I have lost with "scissors" against "rock" (rounds 80, 96, 122).
   - I have lost with "paper" against "scissors" (rounds 100, 105, 114, 120, 121, 124, 127).

3. **Ties**:
   - Ties occur when both play the same move, which has happened with all three moves.

4. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to play "scissors" quite frequently, especially when I play "paper".
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays "rock" after I play "scissors" and "paper" after I play "rock".
   - The opponent's strategy might involve a cycle with a bias towards "scissors" when I play "paper".

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to cycle through "rock", "paper", and "scissors" with a bias towards playing "scissors" more frequently, especially when I play "paper".
   - This aligns with the previous hypothesis but with a stronger emphasis on the opponent's tendency to play "scissors" when I play "paper".

6. **Strategy Implication**:
   - To counter this, I should consider playing "rock" more often, especially after I play "paper", as the opponent tends to play "scissors" in response to my "paper".

Based on this analysis, here's the refined hypothesis:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing scissors more frequently, especially when player_0 plays paper.',
    'value': 0.31764570000000003,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to cycle through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing scissors more frequently, especially when I play paper, and considering that I played paper in the last round, it is likely that the opponent will play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.52235199, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.52235199, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. This was based on data up to round 101.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 79 to 128, the opponent's plays were: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper,

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Analyzing the interaction history, the opponent's plays seem to be somewhat random, with no clear pattern emerging. However, they have played 'rock' in the last round. Given the lack of a discernible pattern and their last play being 'rock', it is possible they might continue with 'rock' or switch to another option. Since there is no strong indication of a specific play, I will assume they might continue with 'rock'.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the possibility of the opponent playing 'rock', my best move would be 'paper', as it beats 'rock'.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.665646393, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.665646393, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and assess any patterns:

1. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent has played each option (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times, but there seems to be a noticeable frequency of paper.
   - From round 80 to 129, the opponent played paper 15 times, rock 9 times, and scissors 7 times.

2. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I played rock, I received positive rewards against scissors and ties against rock.
   - When I played paper, I received positive rewards against rock and ties against paper.
   - When I played scissors, I received positive rewards against paper and negative rewards against rock.

3. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a cycle with a bias towards paper. This seems consistent with the observed plays.
   - The opponent's strategy might involve cycling through rock, paper, and scissors, but with a higher frequency of playing paper.

4. **Strategy Implications**:
   - Given the bias towards paper, playing scissors more frequently could yield positive rewards.
   - However, the opponent also plays rock and scissors, so a balanced approach with a slight bias towards scissors might be optimal.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent appears to cycle through rock, paper, and scissors, with a slight bias towards paper. This suggests a non-random but predictable pattern that can be exploited by favoring scissors.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.',
    'value': 0.665646393,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering the last play was paper, it is likely that the opponent will continue this cycle. Since they played paper last, they might play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering the last play was scissors, it is likely that the opponent will follow their cycle and play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.3197216989593, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.3197216989593, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. The predicted next play was rock, and my counter was paper.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - The opponent has played scissors more frequently in recent rounds (rounds 133, 127, 124, 121, 120, 114, 105, 100).
   - The opponent also played rock and paper, but scissors appears more frequently in the recent rounds.
   - My plays of paper have resulted in negative rewards when the opponent plays scissors.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to have a pattern where scissors is played more frequently, especially after a series of rounds where paper was played by me.
   - There are instances where the opponent's play of rock and paper are interspersed, but scissors appears to be a more frequent choice in recent rounds.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play rock against scissors.
   - Negative rewards are obtained when I play paper against scissors.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent may have shifted their strategy to favor scissors more frequently, possibly in response to my frequent plays of paper.
   - The previous hypothesis of cycling with a bias towards paper may still hold, but with an increased frequency of scissors in recent rounds.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve a cycle with a recent bias towards playing scissors more frequently.
   - To counter this, I should consider playing rock more often, as it counters scissors effectively.

Based on this analysis, here is the refined hypothesis:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a recent bias towards playing scissors more frequently.',
    'value': 0.3197216989593,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a recent bias towards playing scissors more frequently, and considering that they played scissors in the last round, it is likely that they will continue this pattern and play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, I should play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.52380518927151, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis:**
   - From rounds 85 to 134, I have observed a mix of outcomes: wins, losses, and ties.
   - Wins are mostly achieved when I play rock against scissors, paper against rock, and scissors against paper.
   - Losses occur when I play scissors against rock and paper against scissors.
   - Ties happen when both my opponent and I play the same move.

2. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - There seems to be a pattern where my opponent plays each move (rock, paper, scissors) with some regularity, but with a slight bias towards paper.
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a cycle through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards paper.

3. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - Given the observed outcomes, the hypothesis that my opponent cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards paper still holds.
   - The bias towards paper is evident as I have had several ties and losses when playing paper, indicating my opponent plays scissors more frequently than rock.

4. **Static Strategy Consideration:**
   - When I play rock, I often win against scissors, suggesting my opponent plays scissors after paper.
   - When I play paper, I sometimes lose to scissors, supporting the idea of a cycle with a bias towards paper.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - My opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern with a slight bias towards paper, meaning they might play scissors more frequently after paper.
   - To exploit this, I should consider playing rock more often, as it counters scissors effectively.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.',
    'value': 0.52380518927151,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering the last play was rock, it is likely that their next play will be scissors, following the cycle pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent's likely next play is scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.666663632490057, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.666663632490057, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. This hypothesis was made at round 101, with a prediction that the opponent would play paper next.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - From rounds 86 to 135, there are several instances where the opponent played paper, especially when I played rock, resulting in a loss for me.
   - There are also instances where the opponent played rock and scissors, but paper seems to appear more frequently in critical situations where I played rock.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play paper more often, especially when I play rock. This aligns with the previous hypothesis.
   - There are sequences where the opponent plays rock and scissors, but paper appears to be a frequent choice, especially when it can counter my rock.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play rock, I often receive a negative reward, indicating the opponent plays paper frequently enough to counter it.
   - When I play paper, I tend to receive positive rewards, suggesting the opponent plays rock or scissors less frequently.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a strategy that involves cycling through rock, paper, and scissors, with a noticeable bias towards playing paper more frequently.
   - This bias towards paper suggests that playing scissors more often could yield positive rewards for me, as it counters paper effectively.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the previous one, with a slight emphasis on the frequency of paper plays.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering their last play was paper, it is likely they will continue their cycle and play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                The total interaction history is: [{'round': 90, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 91, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 92, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 93, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 94, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 95, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 96, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 97, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 98, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 99, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 100, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 101, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 102, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 103, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 104, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 105, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 106, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 107, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 108, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 109, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 110, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 111, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 112, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 113, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 114, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 115, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 116, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 117, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 118, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 119, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 120, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 121, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 122, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 123, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 124, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 125, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 126, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 127, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 128, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 129, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 130, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 131, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 132, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 133, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 134, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 135, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 136, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 137, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 138, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 139, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}].
                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.3199659381608627, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.3199659381608627, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and look for patterns:

1. **Winning Plays**: 
   - I have won consistently when playing "scissors" against "paper" (rounds 90, 93, 110, 113, 119, 126, 132, 138).
   - I have also won when playing "rock" against "scissors" (rounds 91, 94, 108, 111, 117, 130, 136).
   - I have won when playing "paper" against "rock" (rounds 92, 95, 101, 106, 109, 112, 115, 118, 125, 131, 137).

2. **Losing Plays**:
   - I have lost when playing "paper" against "scissors" (rounds 100, 105, 114, 120, 121, 124, 127, 133, 139).
   - I have lost when playing "scissors" against "rock" (rounds 96, 122).
   - I have lost when playing "rock" against "paper" (round 135).

3. **Ties**:
   - Ties occur when both players choose the same option (rounds 97, 98, 102, 103, 104, 107, 116, 123, 128, 129, 134).

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play "scissors" after I play "paper", as seen in the losses when I played "paper" and they played "scissors".
   - The opponent also plays "rock" occasionally after I play "scissors", leading to my losses.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays "rock" after I play "scissors" and "scissors" after I play "paper".

5. **Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent might be cycling through "rock", "paper", and "scissors" but with a bias towards playing "scissors" more frequently after I play "paper".
   - They also seem to play "rock" more frequently after I play "scissors".

Based on this analysis, my strategy should focus on countering the opponent's tendency to play "scissors" after I play "paper" by playing "rock" instead. Additionally, I should play "paper" when I anticipate the opponent playing "rock" after my "scissors".

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing scissors after I play paper and rock after I play scissors.',
    'value': 0.3199659381608627,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
        'my_next_play': 'rock'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing scissors after I play paper, and considering that I last played paper, it is likely that the opponent will play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.5239761567126039, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To hypothesize about the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. This hypothesis was made around round 101.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - From rounds 91 to 140, the opponent's plays are: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, rock, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock.
   - Observing these plays, there seems to be a pattern where the opponent plays each option (rock, paper, scissors) with some regularity, but paper appears slightly more often.

3. **Analysis of Outcomes**:
   - When I play rock, I have received positive rewards against scissors and ties against rock. Negative outcomes occur when the opponent plays paper.
   - When I play paper, I have received positive rewards against rock and negative outcomes against scissors.
   - When I play scissors, I have received positive rewards against paper and negative outcomes against rock.

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to play rock, paper, and scissors in a somewhat cyclical manner, with a slight bias towards paper. This aligns with the previous hypothesis.
   - The opponent's strategy does not appear to adapt to my plays, suggesting a static or predetermined sequence.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern with a slight bias towards paper. This means they might play paper slightly more often than rock or scissors.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit this pattern by playing scissors more frequently to counter their bias towards paper.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.',
    'value': 0.5239761567126039,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering the last play was a tie with both playing rock, it is likely that the opponent will continue their cycle. Since they played rock last, their next play might be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my best move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {101: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.6667833096988227, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

   - I have won with 'scissors' against 'paper' multiple times (rounds: 93, 99, 110, 113, 119, 126, 132, 138, 141).
   - I have won with 'rock' against 'scissors' multiple times (rounds: 94, 108, 111, 117, 130, 136).

2. **Losing Plays**:
   - I lost with 'scissors' against 'rock' (rounds: 96, 122).
   - I lost with 'paper' against 'scissors' (rounds: 100, 105, 114, 120, 121, 124, 127, 133, 139).
   - I lost with 'rock' against 'paper' (round: 135).

3. **Ties**:
   - Ties occurred with 'paper' vs 'paper' (rounds: 97, 104, 107, 116, 123, 129).
   - Ties occurred with 'rock' vs 'rock' (rounds: 98, 103, 128, 134, 140).
   - Ties occurred with 'scissors' vs 'scissors' (round: 102).

**Pattern Analysis**:
- The opponent seems to play 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors' in a cycle but with a noticeable bias towards 'paper'. This is evident from the frequent ties when I played 'paper' and the losses when I played 'paper' against their 'scissors'.
- The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclic pattern with a higher frequency of 'paper', which aligns with my previous hypothesis.

**Hypothesis**:
The opponent is likely cycling through 'rock', 'paper', and 'scissors', with a bias towards playing 'paper' more frequently. This is supported by the frequent wins when I played 'scissors' and the losses when I played 'paper' against their 'scissors'.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.',
    'value': 0.6667833096988227,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering the last play was paper, it is likely that the opponent will continue this pattern and play paper again.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my best move would be to play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {106: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {106: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and see if there are any patterns or biases in their plays.

1. **Observation of Patterns:**
   - From rounds 93 to 142, the opponent's plays are as follows:
     - Rock: 10 times
     - Paper: 12 times
     - Scissors: 8 times

   The distribution of the opponent's plays seems relatively balanced, with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently than scissors.

2. **Analysis of My Rewards:**
   - Positive rewards (+3) are obtained when I play:
     - Scissors against paper
     - Rock against scissors
     - Paper against rock
   - Negative rewards (-1) are obtained when I play:
     - Scissors against rock
     - Paper against scissors
     - Rock against paper
   - Ties (0) occur when both play the same.

3. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent seems to cycle through rock, paper, and scissors, but there is a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.
   - This bias towards paper suggests that playing scissors might yield more positive rewards, as it counters paper effectively.

4. **Strategy Adjustment:**
   - Given the slight bias towards paper, a strategy that favors playing scissors could be beneficial. However, it's important to remain adaptable in case the opponent changes their pattern.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cycle through rock, paper, and scissors, with a slight bias towards paper.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis of the opponent's strategy, which suggests they cycle through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing scissors, it is likely that the opponent will continue their cycle. Given this pattern, their next play is likely to be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my best move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {106: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and the previous hypothesis.

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was hypothesized to cycle through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently. This hypothesis predicted the opponent's next play as rock, and suggested playing paper as a counter.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Wins with Rock**: In rounds 94, 108, 111, 117, 130, and 136, playing rock resulted in a win against scissors.
   - **Wins with Paper**: In rounds 95, 101, 106, 109, 112, 115, 118, 125, 131, and 137, playing paper resulted in a win against rock.
   - **Wins with Scissors**: In rounds 99, 110, 113, 119, 126, 132, 138, and 141, playing scissors resulted in a win against paper.
   - **Losses with Scissors**: In rounds 96, 122, and 143, playing scissors resulted in a loss against rock.
   - **Losses with Paper**: In rounds 100, 105, 114, 120, 121, 124, 127, and 133, playing paper resulted in a loss against scissors.
   - **Losses with Rock**: In round 135, playing rock resulted in a loss against paper.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to play rock frequently, as evidenced by the number of times paper won against rock.
   - There are also several instances where scissors lost to rock, supporting the hypothesis of a bias towards rock.
   - The opponent's plays do not seem to follow a strict cycle, but there is a noticeable tendency to favor rock.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely favors rock but occasionally plays paper and scissors, possibly in a less predictable pattern than a strict cycle.
   - The strategy could be a weighted random choice with a higher probability for rock.

5. **Strategy Implication**:
   - Given the bias towards rock, playing paper more frequently could yield positive rewards.
   - However, occasional plays of scissors and rock should be considered to counter potential shifts in the opponent's strategy.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Favors rock with occasional plays of paper and scissors, likely using a weighted random choice with a higher probability for rock.',
    'value': 0.55,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of favoring rock with occasional plays of paper and scissors, and considering the last few rounds where they played rock twice in a row, it is likely that their next play will be rock again.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {106: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was hypothesized to cycle through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently. This hypothesis was made at round 106.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 95 to 144, the opponent's plays are as follows:
     - Rock: 10 times
     - Paper: 11 times
     - Scissors: 8 times

3. **Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays are relatively balanced among rock, paper, and scissors, but there is a slight tendency to play paper more frequently in recent rounds.
   - The hypothesis of cycling through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards rock doesn't fully align with the recent data, as paper has been played slightly more often.
   - The opponent's strategy might be shifting or adapting slightly, or it could be a longer cycle that wasn't fully captured in the previous hypothesis.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing paper against rock and scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards were obtained when playing paper against scissors and rock against paper.
   - Ties occurred when both played the same move.

5. **Refined Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent might be cycling through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently in recent rounds. This could be a part of a longer cycle or a slight adaptation.

6. **Strategy**:
   - Given the slight bias towards paper, playing scissors might yield more positive rewards if the bias continues.
   - However, it's important to remain adaptable and observe if the pattern shifts again.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently in recent rounds.',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the previous analysis, the opponent seems to cycle through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. In the most recent rounds, they played paper twice and rock once. Given this pattern and the prediction from the last round, it is likely that the opponent will play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {115: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing scissors more frequently.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {115: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing scissors more frequently.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent has played each of rock, paper, and scissors multiple times.
   - There are several instances of ties, indicating that the opponent's plays are not entirely predictable.
   - The opponent seems to play scissors frequently, as evidenced by multiple losses when I played paper.
   - There are also instances where the opponent played rock and paper, but scissors appear more frequently.

2. **Previous Hypothesis**:
   - The previous hypothesis suggested that the opponent cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing scissors more frequently.
   - This hypothesis predicted the opponent's next play as rock, and my next play as paper.

3. **Current Observations**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a pattern where scissors are played more often, but there is no strict cycle.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent has a bias towards scissors still holds, as there are multiple instances of the opponent playing scissors.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing rock against scissors.
   - Negative rewards are obtained when playing paper against scissors.
   - The hypothesis of a bias towards scissors is supported by the fact that playing rock has often resulted in positive rewards.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent likely has a strategy that involves playing scissors more frequently than rock or paper.
   - This strategy can be exploited by playing rock more often, as it counters scissors effectively.

Based on the analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the observed data. The opponent's strategy appears to involve a bias towards playing scissors.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Bias towards playing scissors more frequently than rock or paper.',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's tendency to play scissors more frequently, and the fact that the last round was a tie with both playing paper, it is likely that the opponent will revert to their bias and play scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {141: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. This was noted at round 141 with a prediction that the opponent would play paper next.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - The opponent has played a mix of rock, paper, and scissors, but there are notable patterns:
     - **Paper**: Played in rounds 104, 107, 109, 112, 116, 118, 121, 123, 125, 129, 133, 137, 139, 144, 146.
     - **Scissors**: Played in rounds 99, 102, 105, 110, 113, 114, 119, 120, 124, 127, 132, 138, 141, 142, 145.
     - **Rock**: Played in rounds 98, 101, 103, 106, 108, 111, 115, 117, 122, 126, 128, 130, 131, 134, 135, 136, 140, 143, 147.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to play paper slightly more often than the other two options, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.
   - The opponent's plays do not strictly follow a predictable cycle but show a tendency to play paper more frequently.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are often achieved when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing paper against scissors and scissors against rock.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to involve a slight bias towards playing paper, but they also mix in rock and scissors without a strict pattern.
   - This suggests a semi-random strategy with a preference for paper.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the previous one: the opponent cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. This can be exploited by playing scissors more often to counter the frequent paper plays.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a slight bias towards paper, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock, following their cycle pattern.
2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {147: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Bias towards playing scissors more frequently than rock or paper.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {147: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Bias towards playing scissors more frequently than rock or paper.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - From rounds 99 to 148, the opponent has played scissors 16 times, rock 10 times, and paper 9 times.
   - The opponent seems to play scissors more frequently than rock or paper, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.

2. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I played rock, I received positive rewards consistently (e.g., rounds 108, 111, 117, 130, 136, 147).
   - When I played paper, I received negative rewards frequently, especially when the opponent played scissors (e.g., rounds 100, 105, 114, 120, 121, 124, 127, 133, 139, 145, 148).

3. **Previous Hypothesis**:
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a bias towards playing scissors, with a value of 0.3, indicating a 30% likelihood of playing scissors.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - Given the consistent pattern of the opponent playing scissors more frequently, the hypothesis that the opponent has a bias towards scissors remains strong.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a static bias towards playing scissors, which can be exploited by playing rock more frequently.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a static bias towards playing scissors more frequently than rock or paper.
   - I should continue to play rock to exploit this bias and maximize my rewards.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Bias towards playing scissors more frequently than rock or paper.',
    'value': 0.3
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's bias towards playing scissors more frequently, and considering they played scissors in the last round, it is likely they will continue with scissors in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {21: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.282351, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper. This hypothesis suggested that the opponent tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays from rounds 100 to 149 show a pattern where paper is played frequently, especially after rock.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays scissors after paper, and rock after scissors, suggesting a cyclic pattern.
   - The opponent has played paper 16 times, scissors 13 times, and rock 10 times in the last 50 rounds, indicating a slight preference for paper.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards were obtained when playing paper against scissors and scissors against rock.
   - Ties occurred when both played the same move.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cyclic pattern with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently.
   - The pattern could be: paper -> scissors -> rock, with occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.

5. **Strategy to Counter**:
   - Given the opponent's tendency to play paper more often, playing scissors could yield positive rewards.
   - However, due to the cyclic nature, it might be beneficial to anticipate the cycle and play rock when expecting scissors, and paper when expecting rock.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. Occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.',
    'value': 0.282351,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
        'my_next_play': 'scissors'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering the last play was rock, it is likely that the opponent will reset to paper after playing rock. Therefore, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {21: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {21: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.49764569999999997, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. They tend to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Paper**: The opponent has played paper in rounds 101, 104, 107, 112, 116, 119, 123, 129, 131, 137, 144, 146. This seems to align with the hypothesis that paper is played frequently.
   - **Scissors**: The opponent has played scissors in rounds 102, 105, 110, 113, 114, 120, 121, 124, 127, 133, 139, 142, 145, 148. Scissors appear frequently, often following paper.
   - **Rock**: The opponent has played rock in rounds 103, 106, 109, 111, 115, 118, 125, 128, 130, 134, 136, 140, 143, 149. Rock appears less frequently than paper and scissors.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern of playing paper more frequently, with scissors and rock interspersed.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper still holds. The frequent appearance of paper supports this.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are often obtained when I play scissors, which counters the frequent paper plays by the opponent.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play paper against their scissors or rock, indicating that scissors is a safer choice against their frequent paper.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to be a cycle with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. This aligns with the previous hypothesis.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis remains valid and can be used to inform my strategy moving forward.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.49764569999999997,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, and considering the last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {21: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.64835199, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {21: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.64835199, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. They tend to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - From rounds 102 to 151, we observe a pattern where the opponent often plays scissors after paper and rock after scissors. This aligns with the previous hypothesis of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays the same move consecutively, but these are less frequent.
   - The opponent seems to favor playing scissors after paper, which is consistent with the cycling pattern.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has consistently given positive rewards when the opponent plays scissors (rounds 108, 111, 117, 130, 136, 147, 151).
   - Playing paper has been successful against rock (rounds 106, 109, 112, 115, 118, 125, 131, 137).
   - Playing scissors has been successful against paper (rounds 110, 113, 119, 126, 132, 138, 141, 150).

4. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a predictable cycle of paper, scissors, rock. This cycle is occasionally interrupted, but the pattern largely holds.
   - The opponent's play after a reset or interruption often returns to paper, supporting the hypothesis of a reset to paper.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely following a cyclic strategy with a pattern of paper, scissors, rock. They occasionally reset to paper, especially after playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the previous one. The opponent's strategy can be exploited by anticipating their next move in the cycle and playing the counter move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.64835199,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper, and considering that they played scissors last, it is likely that their next play will be rock, as they tend to follow the cycle and play rock after scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.753846393, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper, and considering their tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, it is likely that their next play will be scissors. This is because they played rock in the last round, and they often follow rock with scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors in the next round, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {150: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. Occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {

                }

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {150: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. Occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and my previous hypothesis:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. There are occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.

2. **Recent Plays**:
   - Round 153: Opponent played paper against my rock.
   - Round 152: Opponent played rock against my paper.
   - Round 151: Opponent played scissors against my rock.
   - Round 150: Opponent played paper against my scissors.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play paper more often, as seen in rounds 153, 150, and 144.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where after playing rock (round 152), the opponent resets to paper (round 153).
   - The opponent's plays do not seem to be purely random, as there is a discernible pattern of cycling through the choices with a bias towards paper.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have received positive rewards when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards are often received when I play paper against scissors or rock against paper.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic pattern of paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.
   - The pattern suggests that after playing rock, the opponent tends to reset to paper.

6. **Strategy Implication**:
   - To exploit this pattern, I should consider playing scissors more frequently, especially after the opponent plays rock, as they are likely to reset to paper.

Based on this analysis, my refined hypothesis is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards paper. Tends to reset to paper after playing rock.',
    'value': 0.35,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards paper, and their tendency to reset to paper after playing rock, I predict their next play will be paper. This is consistent with their pattern of playing paper after rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.

                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {150: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. Occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Review of Interaction History:**
   - The opponent has played a mix of rock, paper, and scissors.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays the same move consecutively, such as paper in rounds 123 and 124, and scissors in rounds 120 and 121.
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play paper more frequently, as observed in rounds 105, 107, 109, 112, 115, 118, 121, 123, 125, 129, 131, 133, 137, 139, 144, 146, 148, and 152.

2. **Previous Hypothesis:**
   - The previous hypothesis suggested that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. There is also a mention of occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.

3. **Analysis of Rewards:**
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards are observed when playing paper against scissors and rock against paper.
   - The opponent's frequent use of paper suggests that playing scissors might yield more positive rewards.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve cycling through the moves with a bias towards paper. This is consistent with the previous hypothesis.
   - The opponent might reset to paper after playing rock, as seen in rounds 153 and 154.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern with a bias towards paper. This pattern involves playing paper more frequently and occasionally resetting to paper after playing rock.

Based on this analysis, the strategy to counter the opponent would be to play scissors more frequently, as it counters the opponent's bias towards paper.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.',
    'value': 0.51,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering the last play was scissors, it is likely that the opponent will continue their cycle. After playing scissors, the next in their cycle would be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent will play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {150: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. Occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with a slight bias towards playing paper more frequently. There are occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 106 to 155, there are several instances where the opponent plays rock after playing paper or scissors.
   - The opponent seems to play rock frequently after a sequence of paper or scissors, which aligns with the previous hypothesis of cycling through the choices.
   - There are multiple instances where playing paper against the opponent's rock has resulted in positive rewards for me.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a pattern where rock appears frequently after paper or scissors.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays rock after a sequence of paper and scissors, which suggests a cycle or a reset to rock.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing paper has often resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays rock.
   - There are instances where playing scissors has also resulted in positive rewards when the opponent plays paper.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern of paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play rock more frequently after paper or scissors.
   - The opponent might reset to rock after a sequence of paper and scissors, which can be exploited by playing paper more frequently.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the previous one, with a slight emphasis on the opponent's tendency to play rock after a sequence of paper and scissors.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors, and considering their last play was rock, it is likely they will continue the cycle and play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, I should play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {151: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

     - Rock: 108, 111, 115, 118, 125, 131, 137, 152, 155

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to play paper frequently, especially after playing rock.
   - There are sequences where the opponent plays paper, followed by scissors, and then rock.
   - The opponent's play of paper is often followed by scissors, indicating a possible cycle of paper -> scissors -> rock.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve a cycle with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing paper against scissors.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic pattern of paper -> scissors -> rock with a tendency to reset to paper more often.
   - This pattern suggests that after playing rock, the opponent is more likely to play paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.',
    'value': 0.35,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

This hypothesis suggests that playing rock after the opponent plays paper or rock could be beneficial, as it counters their likely next move of scissors or paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering their last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {151: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {151: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper. It was noted that they tend to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - **Rounds 108-113**: The opponent played a sequence that allowed me to win consistently with rock, paper, and scissors.
   - **Rounds 114-116**: The opponent's plays resulted in losses or ties for me, indicating a shift or reset in their strategy.
   - **Rounds 117-119**: I won again with rock, paper, and scissors, suggesting a repeat of their earlier sequence.
   - **Rounds 120-124**: Losses and ties occurred, indicating another shift or reset.
   - **Rounds 125-127**: Wins with paper and scissors, followed by a loss, suggest a partial repeat of their sequence.
   - **Rounds 128-130**: Ties and a win with rock suggest a continuation or modification of their sequence.
   - **Rounds 131-133**: Wins with paper and scissors, followed by a loss, indicate a pattern.
   - **Rounds 134-136**: Ties and a win with rock suggest a continuation.
   - **Rounds 137-139**: Wins with paper and scissors, followed by a loss, suggest a pattern.
   - **Rounds 140-142**: Ties and a win with scissors suggest a continuation.
   - **Rounds 143-145**: Losses and ties indicate a shift or reset.
   - **Rounds 146-148**: Wins with rock, followed by a loss, suggest a partial repeat.
   - **Rounds 149-151**: Ties and wins with rock suggest a continuation.
   - **Rounds 152-154**: Wins with paper and scissors, followed by a tie, suggest a pattern.
   - **Rounds 155-157**: Wins with paper, scissors, and rock suggest a repeat of their sequence.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cyclic pattern with occasional resets.
   - They tend to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.
   - The sequence often results in wins for me when I play rock, paper, and scissors in a specific order.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclic pattern with occasional resets, favoring paper after rock or a reset.
   - This pattern can be exploited by anticipating their next move based on the observed sequence.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy remains consistent with the previous one, with a slight refinement in recognizing the cyclic pattern and resets.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.51,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper, and considering their last play was scissors (since I played rock and won), it is likely that their next play will be rock, as they tend to follow the cycle and play rock after scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                The total interaction history is: [{'round': 109, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 110, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 111, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 112, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 113, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 114, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 115, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 116, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 117, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 118, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 119, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 120, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 121, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 122, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 123, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 124, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 125, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 126, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 127, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 128, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 129, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 130, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 131, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 132, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 133, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 134, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 135, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 136, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 137, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 138, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 139, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 140, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 141, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 142, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 143, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 144, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 145, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 146, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 147, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 148, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 149, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 150, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 151, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 152, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 153, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 154, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 155, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 156, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 157, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 158, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}].
                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {151: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {151: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis (Round 151):**
   - The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper.
   - Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.
   - Predicted opponent's next play was rock, and my next play was paper.

2. **Recent Interaction History (Rounds 109-158):**
   - Wins: 109 (P vs R), 110 (S vs P), 111 (R vs S), 112 (P vs R), 113 (S vs P), 115 (P vs R), 117 (R vs S), 118 (P vs R), 119 (S vs P), 125 (P vs R), 126 (S vs P), 130 (R vs S), 131 (P vs R), 132 (S vs P), 136 (R vs S), 137 (P vs R), 138 (S vs P), 141 (S vs P), 147 (R vs S), 150 (S vs P), 151 (R vs S), 152 (P vs R), 155 (P vs R), 156 (S vs P), 157 (R vs S), 158 (P vs R).
   - Losses: 114 (P vs S), 120 (P vs S), 121 (P vs S), 122 (S vs R), 124 (P vs S), 127 (P vs S), 133 (P vs S), 135 (R vs P), 139 (P vs S), 143 (S vs R), 145 (P vs S), 148 (P vs S), 153 (R vs P).
   - Ties: 116 (P vs P), 123 (P vs P), 128 (R vs R), 129 (P vs P), 134 (R vs R), 140 (R vs R), 142 (S vs S), 144 (P vs P), 146 (P vs P), 149 (R vs R), 154 (S vs S).

3. **Analysis:**
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after playing rock or after a reset.
   - The hypothesis from round 151 still holds as the opponent's plays align with the predicted pattern.
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a predictable cycle with a bias towards playing paper after certain plays.

4. **Strategy Implications:**
   - Given the opponent's tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, playing scissors after observing rock or a reset could be advantageous.
   - Continue exploiting the pattern by playing the counter to the predicted next play.

Based on this analysis, the previous hypothesis remains valid and can be reiterated.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper, and considering they played rock in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be to play scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, and given that their last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

            You last played: rock
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.94235199, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, and considering their last play was scissors (since I played rock and won), it is likely that their next play will be rock as they continue their cycle.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {151: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3717524751000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python

                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {151: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3717524751000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and the previous hypothesis:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper. It was noted that they tend to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - From rounds 116 to 165, we observe a pattern where the opponent plays paper, scissors, and rock in a somewhat cyclical manner. 
   - There are instances where the opponent plays the same move consecutively (e.g., paper at rounds 116, 123, 129, 144, 146).
   - The opponent seems to play paper more frequently after playing rock or after a reset, aligning with the previous hypothesis.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays are not entirely random; they seem to follow a pattern where paper is played more frequently, especially after rock.
   - The opponent's strategy does not appear to adapt based on my plays, as they continue to follow their cycle regardless of my actions.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play scissors against rock and paper against scissors.
   - The opponent's frequent use of paper suggests a potential opportunity to exploit by playing scissors more often, especially after observing a rock play.

5. **Refined Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently, especially after rock or a reset.
   - This pattern suggests a non-adaptive, cyclical strategy that can be countered by predicting their next move based on the cycle.

Based on this analysis, I will refine the hypothesis to better capture the observed pattern:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after rock or a reset. Non-adaptive cyclical pattern.',
    'value': 0.45,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after rock or a reset, and considering the last play was rock, it is likely that the opponent will play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of paper, my best move would be to play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {151: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.5602267325700001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Observing the opponent's pattern, they tend to switch to a play that beats my last play. After I played scissors, they might play rock next to counter it.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, I should play paper.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {151: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.6921587127990001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {151: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.6921587127990001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was hypothesized to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper. It was noted that they tend to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - The opponent played scissors after paper (round 167).
   - Before that, they played rock after scissors (round 165 to 166).
   - They played paper after rock (round 164 to 165).

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern of playing paper, scissors, and rock in a cycle.
   - There are occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.
   - The opponent's plays align with the previous hypothesis of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing rock against scissors.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing paper against scissors.
   - This suggests that the opponent's play of scissors can be anticipated and countered with rock.

5. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclic pattern with a tendency to reset to paper after playing rock.
   - This pattern can be exploited by predicting their next move based on the cycle and playing the counter strategy.

Based on the above analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.',
    'value': 0.6921587127990001,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

This hypothesis suggests that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, and the counter strategy would be to play rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely they will continue the cycle and play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset, and given that their last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {155: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {155: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. There was also an observation of occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - The opponent has played paper 5 times, scissors 3 times, and rock 2 times in the last 10 rounds.
   - The opponent's plays in the last 10 rounds: paper, paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper, rock, paper, scissors, paper.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to favor paper more frequently, consistent with the previous hypothesis.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays paper more often after playing rock, which aligns with the hypothesis of resetting to paper after rock.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play rock, I often receive a negative reward, indicating the opponent frequently plays paper.
   - Playing scissors has yielded positive rewards when the opponent plays paper.
   - Playing paper has been effective against the opponent's rock plays.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely continues to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a stronger bias towards paper.
   - The pattern of resetting to paper after rock is consistent and can be exploited.

6. **Strategy Implication**:
   - To counter this strategy, I should consider playing scissors more frequently to exploit the opponent's bias towards paper.
   - Additionally, I should be cautious when playing rock, as it often results in a negative reward.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. Frequently resets to paper after playing rock.',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a strong bias towards playing paper, and frequently resetting to paper after playing rock, I believe their next play will be scissors. This is because they played paper in the last round, and their pattern suggests a move to scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their move and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {155: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. There are occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 122 to 171, we observe a pattern where the opponent plays each option (rock, paper, scissors) multiple times.
   - The opponent seems to play paper more frequently than the other two options.
   - After playing rock, the opponent often switches to paper.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cycle but with a noticeable bias towards paper.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent resets to paper after playing rock is supported by the data.
   - The opponent's strategy might not be purely random but rather a fixed cycle with a bias.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has often resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - Playing paper has also been successful, particularly when the opponent plays rock.
   - Scissors have been less successful, indicating the opponent might not play paper as frequently as initially thought.

5. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cycle of paper, scissors, rock but with a higher frequency of paper.
   - The strategy includes a tendency to reset to paper after playing rock.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the previous one, with a slight refinement in understanding the frequency of paper plays.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently. Occasional resets to paper, especially after playing rock.',
    'value': 0.51,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, and considering the last play was rock, it is likely that the opponent will play paper next. This is because after playing rock, they often reset to paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {156: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

Response:

Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. There are occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - The opponent played rock in rounds 170 and 172, and paper in round 171.
   - Before that, they played paper in round 168, scissors in round 169, and rock in round 170.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cycle of paper, scissors, and rock, but with a tendency to play rock more frequently after playing paper or scissors.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where after playing paper and scissors, the opponent tends to play rock.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I played rock, I received positive rewards against scissors (rounds 130, 136, 147, 151, 157, 160, 163, 171).
   - When I played paper, I received positive rewards against rock (rounds 125, 131, 137, 152, 155, 158, 161, 164, 168).
   - When I played scissors, I received positive rewards against paper (rounds 126, 132, 138, 141, 150, 156, 159, 162, 166, 169).

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve a cycle of paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors.
   - The opponent occasionally resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy can be exploited by anticipating their cycle and bias towards rock. Playing paper after observing a pattern of paper and scissors could yield positive rewards.

Based on this analysis, I will refine the hypothesis as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors, and considering that they just played rock after I played scissors, it is likely that they will continue their cycle. Therefore, their next play is likely to be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {156: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {156: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. There were occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.

2. **Recent Plays**:
   - Round 173: Opponent played paper, I played scissors and won.
   - Round 172: Opponent played rock, I played scissors and lost.
   - Round 171: Opponent played scissors, I played rock and won.
   - Round 170: Opponent played paper, I played rock and lost.
   - Round 169: Opponent played paper, I played scissors and won.
   - Round 168: Opponent played rock, I played paper and won.
   - Round 167: Opponent played scissors, I played paper and lost.
   - Round 166: Opponent played paper, I played scissors and won.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play paper after playing rock or scissors.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays paper after playing rock or scissors, which aligns with the previous hypothesis of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock.
   - The opponent has a tendency to play rock after playing paper, which supports the idea of a cycle with a slight bias towards rock.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have been getting positive rewards when playing scissors against the opponent's paper.
   - I have also been successful with rock against the opponent's scissors.

5. **Refined Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent is likely following a cyclic pattern of paper, scissors, and rock, with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. This pattern seems to reset occasionally to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.

Based on this analysis, the strategy to counter the opponent would be to anticipate their next move in the cycle and play the counter move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.',
    'value': 0.51,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
        'my_next_play': 'scissors'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors, and considering their last play was paper, it is likely they will play scissors next. However, given the occasional reset to rock after playing paper and scissors, there is also a possibility they might play rock. Considering the pattern, scissors seems more probable.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. There were occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - From rounds 125 to 174, the opponent's plays were: rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock,

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Observing the interaction history, the opponent has shown a tendency to play scissors after losing to rock. Since I played rock and won in the last round, it is likely that the opponent will play scissors again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.7599, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors, and considering the last play was a tie with both playing rock, it is likely that the opponent will continue their cycle. Given the pattern, the opponent might play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my best move would be to play scissors, which beats paper.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'

            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.882351, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors, and considering the last play was scissors followed by rock, it is likely that the opponent will play paper next. This is because they tend to cycle through the sequence and have a pattern of playing paper after rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter-move would be to play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {156: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.31764570000000003, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {156: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.31764570000000003, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. There were occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - The opponent's plays in the last few rounds were: rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock.
   - There seems to be a pattern where the opponent plays rock more frequently, especially after playing paper or scissors.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent tends to play rock after playing paper or scissors. This aligns with the previous hypothesis of a cycle with a bias towards rock.
   - The opponent's strategy might involve a predictable cycle with a preference for rock, especially after playing paper or scissors.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards were obtained when playing scissors against rock and paper against scissors.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern of paper, scissors, rock, with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors.
   - The opponent might reset to rock occasionally, especially after playing paper and scissors.

6. **Strategy Implications**:
   - To exploit this pattern, playing paper when expecting rock and scissors when expecting paper could yield positive rewards.
   - Given the bias towards rock, playing paper more frequently might be beneficial.

Based on this analysis, the refined hypothesis is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors, and considering their last play was rock, it is likely they will continue the cycle and play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Observing the interaction history, the opponent seems to have a tendency to play the move that would have beaten my last move. For example, after I played scissors and won, they often played rock in the next round. Given that I last played scissors and won, it is likely that the opponent will play rock in the next round to counter scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {157: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {157: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. This hypothesis predicted the opponent would play scissors after rock.

2. **Interaction History**: 
   - The opponent has shown a pattern of playing scissors after paper and rock after scissors.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays paper after rock, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cycle: paper → scissors → rock, but with some deviations.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - From rounds 131 to 180, the opponent's plays often follow a cycle, but not strictly. There are deviations where the opponent repeats a move or changes the expected sequence.
   - The opponent tends to play scissors after paper, which is consistent with the hypothesis.
   - The opponent sometimes plays rock after scissors, which is also consistent with the hypothesis.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing paper against scissors and rock against paper.

5. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern with occasional resets to paper, which aligns with the observed plays.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper, still holds.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Likely to play scissors after paper and rock after scissors.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper, and given the last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {157: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To understand the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. The hypothesis predicted that after playing rock, the opponent is likely to play paper.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - Round 181: Opponent played rock, and I played paper, winning the round.
   - Looking at the pattern from rounds 132 to 181, the opponent's plays seem to follow a cycle with some variations:
     - The opponent often plays paper after rock, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.
     - There are instances where the opponent plays scissors after paper and rock after scissors, suggesting a cyclic pattern.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent tends to play rock after scissors, paper after rock, and scissors after paper.
   - There are deviations, but the pattern holds in many instances, indicating a cyclic strategy.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are frequently obtained when playing paper after the opponent plays rock.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play paper against their scissors or rock against their paper.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent resets to paper more frequently seems to hold, as playing paper has often resulted in positive rewards.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic strategy: paper -> scissors -> rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently.
   - This strategy can be exploited by predicting the next move based on the cycle and countering it effectively.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy is a cyclic pattern with a tendency to reset to paper. This can be countered by playing the move that beats the predicted next move in the cycle.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.',
    'value': 0.51,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and given that they played rock in the last round, it is likely that they will play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my best move would be to play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {157: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {157: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. This hypothesis predicted that after playing rock, the opponent would likely play paper.

2. **Recent Plays**: 
   - Round 182: Opponent played paper after playing scissors in round 181.
   - Round 181: Opponent played rock after playing scissors in round 180.
   - Round 180: Opponent played scissors after playing paper in round 179.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cycle of paper, scissors, rock, and occasionally resets to paper after rock.
   - This pattern aligns with the previous hypothesis, where the opponent tends to play paper more frequently after completing a cycle.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing scissors against paper and rock against scissors.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing paper against scissors and rock against paper.

5. **Strategy Confirmation**:
   - The hypothesis that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with a tendency to reset to paper is consistent with the observed plays.
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a predictable cycle with a bias towards starting with paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be effectively countered by anticipating their next move in the cycle and playing the counter move.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, and their tendency to reset to paper more frequently, I expect their next play to be scissors, as they played paper in the last round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.9176457, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, and their tendency to reset to paper more frequently, I anticipate that after playing scissors (since they played scissors in the last round), they are likely to play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and given that they played scissors in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of rock, my best move would be to play paper.

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.9903110989592999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering the last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of rock, my best move would be paper.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.9966767069430399, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be paper.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.9988601104814627, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.9996090178951418, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {157: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }

            You last played: scissors

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {157: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.3998084187686195, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. This hypothesis predicted that after playing rock, the opponent would likely play paper.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - From round 154 to 203, there is a noticeable pattern where the opponent frequently plays rock after scissors, and paper after rock. This aligns with the previous hypothesis that the opponent tends to reset to paper after rock.
   - The opponent has played rock after scissors multiple times (rounds 165, 172, 178, 203), which resulted in negative rewards for me when I played scissors.
   - The opponent has played paper after rock consistently (rounds 155, 158, 161, 164, 168, 171, 181, 184, 187, 190, 193, 196, 199, 202), which resulted in positive rewards for me when I played scissors.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cycle: paper → scissors → rock, with a tendency to reset to paper after playing rock.
   - This cycle is consistent with the previous hypothesis, and the pattern of plays supports this observation.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play scissors against the opponent's paper.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play scissors against the opponent's rock.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely following a predictable cycle with a tendency to reset to paper after rock. This cycle is paper → scissors → rock, and then likely back to paper.

Based on this analysis, the previous hypothesis still holds true and explains the data well. Therefore, I will continue to use this hypothesis to inform my strategy.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, and their tendency to reset to paper after playing rock, I predict their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {157: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.5798658931380336, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {157: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.5798658931380336, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Pattern Observation**: From rounds 155 to 204, the opponent's plays seem to follow a cyclical pattern: rock, paper, scissors, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. This is evident from the sequence of my plays and the corresponding opponent plays. For instance, the opponent played rock when I played paper (round 155), paper when I played scissors (round 156), and scissors when I played rock (round 157). This cycle repeats with some variations.

2. **Hypothesis Validation**: The previous hypothesis suggested that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. This hypothesis seems consistent with the observed data, as the opponent often plays paper after rock, which aligns with the hypothesis.

3. **Reward Analysis**: I have been receiving positive rewards when playing scissors against paper, rock against scissors, and paper against rock. This indicates that the opponent's strategy is predictable and can be exploited by playing the counter to their expected next move.

4. **Strategy Refinement**: Given the observed pattern and the positive rewards from countering the opponent's plays, it is likely that the opponent's strategy is a static cycle with a preference for starting or resetting to paper. This means that after playing rock, the opponent is likely to play paper next.

5. **Conclusion**: The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclical pattern with a tendency to reset to paper. This pattern can be exploited by predicting the opponent's next move based on their previous play and countering it accordingly.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.',
    'value': 0.5798658931380336,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering that their last play was paper, it is likely that they will follow their cycle and play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my best move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the observed pattern, the opponent seems to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. In the last round, they played paper, which suggests they might continue the cycle by playing scissors next.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.8991258009424419, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, and given their tendency to reset to paper more frequently after playing rock, it is likely that their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.33213, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.33213, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. The prediction was that they would play scissors after rock.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - From rounds 160 to 209, there is a noticeable pattern where the opponent frequently plays rock after paper and scissors after rock.
   - The opponent tends to play paper after scissors, but not as consistently.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays the same move consecutively, such as scissors in rounds 208 and 209.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cyclic pattern: paper -> rock -> scissors, with occasional deviations.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent resets to paper more frequently is supported by the data, as paper appears often after a cycle.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are consistently obtained when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing scissors against rock or paper against scissors.
   - Ties occur when both play the same move, as seen in round 209 with scissors.

5. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclic pattern with a preference for starting with paper.
   - The cycle is not strictly adhered to, as there are occasional repetitions of the same move.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, rock, scissors with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Occasionally repeats the same move.',
    'value': 0.33213,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, rock, and scissors with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering the last move was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock. This is because they tend to follow the sequence and the next logical move after scissors in their cycle is rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.5324909999999999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.5324909999999999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. The hypothesis predicted that after playing rock, the opponent is likely to play paper.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - From round 161 to 210, the opponent's plays were: rock, paper, scissors, rock, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper,

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Observing the opponent's pattern, they have frequently played rock after I played paper. Given that my last play was paper, it is likely that the opponent will play rock again in the next round.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.6727437, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.6727437, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. The hypothesis predicted that after playing rock, the opponent is likely to play paper.

2. **Recent Plays Analysis**:
   - **Round 209**: Opponent played scissors.
   - **Round 210**: Opponent played rock.
   - **Round 211**: Opponent played paper.

   This sequence (scissors, rock, paper) aligns with the hypothesis that the opponent cycles through these moves. The hypothesis also suggested a tendency to reset to paper, which is consistent with the opponent playing paper in round 211.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a predictable cycle of scissors, rock, paper.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent resets to paper more frequently is supported by the recent play in round 211.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I played scissors against paper, I received a positive reward.
   - When I played rock against scissors, I received a positive reward.
   - When I played paper against rock, I received a positive reward.

   These outcomes suggest that the opponent's strategy is predictable and can be exploited by playing the counter to their expected move.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent is likely following a cyclic strategy of scissors, rock, paper, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently.
   - This strategy can be exploited by anticipating their next move based on the cycle and playing the counter move.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy remains consistent with previous observations. The opponent's predictable cycle allows for a counter-strategy to be effectively employed.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through scissors, rock, paper with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play scissors after paper.',
    'value': 0.75,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through scissors, rock, and paper, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering the last round was a tie with both playing paper, it is likely that the opponent will follow their cycle and play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter-move would be to play rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.92142576237, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and given that they played scissors last (which I countered with rock), it is likely that they will play rock next in their cycle.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.97304903649291, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and given that they played scissors last, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.9968292460943544, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.9989124314103636, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, and their tendency to reset to paper more frequently, it is likely that after playing scissors, they will play rock next. However, since they played scissors last, they might continue the cycle and play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper to win the round.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.9996269639737547, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, and given that they played scissors last, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.39981721234713985, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.39981721234713985, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - From rounds 183 to 232, there is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays a sequence that allows me to win consistently with a cycle of rock, paper, scissors.
   - However, there are exceptions where the opponent plays rock against my scissors in rounds 203 and 232, resulting in a loss for me.

2. **Previous Hypothesis**:
   - The previous hypothesis suggested that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. This hypothesis predicted that after playing rock, the opponent would likely play paper next.

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a predictable pattern most of the time, allowing me to win by cycling through rock, paper, and scissors.
   - However, the opponent occasionally plays rock against my scissors, which deviates from the expected pattern.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy might involve a primary cycle of paper, scissors, rock but occasionally includes a deviation where they play rock against my scissors.
   - This deviation could be a part of their strategy to counter my expected play of scissors after a series of wins.

5. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have been receiving positive rewards when playing rock against scissors, paper against rock, and scissors against paper, indicating a predictable pattern.
   - The negative rewards occur when I play scissors against rock, suggesting the opponent's occasional deviation to rock.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cycle of paper, scissors, rock with occasional deviations to rock, particularly when I play scissors. This suggests a semi-predictable strategy with some randomness or counter-strategy elements.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit the primary cycle while being cautious of the occasional deviation to rock.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional deviations to rock, especially when player_0 plays scissors.',
    'value': 0.45,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional deviations to rock when I play scissors, and considering that I just played scissors, it is likely that the opponent will deviate to rock again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.5798720486429979, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.5798720486429979, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. The prediction was that the opponent would play paper after rock.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 184 to 232, the opponent mostly played rock, paper, and scissors in a predictable cycle, with a few deviations.
   - The opponent played rock at round 232, followed by paper at round 233, which aligns with the previous hypothesis of playing paper after rock.
   - There were ties when I played the same move as the opponent, indicating that the opponent's strategy might not be purely random but rather follows a pattern.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent tends to play paper after rock, which was correctly predicted in the previous hypothesis.
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve cycling through rock, paper, and scissors, but with a bias towards starting or resetting to paper after rock.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing the counter to the opponent's predicted move (e.g., playing scissors when expecting paper).
   - Negative rewards or ties occurred when the opponent's move was not anticipated correctly, or when both played the same move.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic pattern with a tendency to play paper after rock. This pattern can be exploited by predicting the next move based on the observed cycle and bias towards paper.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the previous one, as the opponent's behavior aligns with the predicted pattern.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering that the last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.8991272788791838, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, and the tendency to reset to paper more frequently, they played scissors last. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be rock, following their cycle pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.96540065665556, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and given that their last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper, as paper beats rock.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.99592942185487, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering their last play was scissors, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper.

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.9986037916962204, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering that they played scissors last, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.3990226541873543, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {

                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {205: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.3990226541873543, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The opponent seems to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently.
   - This hypothesis was made around round 205, and it suggested that after playing rock, the opponent is likely to play paper.

2. **Recent Interaction History:**
   - From round 201 to 250, the opponent's plays were mostly predictable based on the hypothesis. 
   - The opponent played rock after paper several times, supporting the hypothesis that they cycle through these moves.
   - There were instances of ties when both played paper, indicating the opponent's frequent return to paper.

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - The opponent's pattern appears to be a cycle of paper, scissors, rock, with a reset to paper more often than not.
   - This pattern is consistent with the hypothesis that the opponent plays paper after rock more frequently.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - Positive rewards were consistently obtained when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occurred when playing scissors against rock, which aligns with the opponent's tendency to play rock after paper.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic pattern of paper, scissors, rock, with a bias towards playing paper after rock.
   - This strategy is predictable and can be exploited by anticipating the opponent's next move based on this cycle.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the observed data. The opponent's strategy can be countered by playing the move that beats the expected next move in their cycle.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.',
    'value': 0.3990226541873543,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering the last play was paper, it is likely that the opponent will continue the cycle and play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {157: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {157: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.3293880606597094, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. This hypothesis predicted that after playing rock, the opponent would likely play paper next.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 202 to 251, the opponent's plays were: rock, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors.
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a pattern of alternating between rock, paper, and scissors, with occasional repetitions of paper and scissors.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent frequently plays rock after scissors and paper after rock.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays paper more frequently, especially after rock.
   - The opponent's recent plays (rounds 250 and 251) were paper and scissors, respectively, which aligns with the hypothesis of cycling through the moves with a tendency to reset to paper.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing paper against rock and scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards occurred when playing scissors against rock and paper against scissors.

5. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic pattern of rock, paper, scissors, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock.
   - The opponent might be using a strategy that involves playing paper after rock and occasionally repeating paper or scissors.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is refined as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock. Likely to play paper after rock and occasionally repeat paper or scissors.',
    'value': 0.3293880606597094,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

This hypothesis suggests that the opponent is likely to play rock next, so I should play paper to maximize my reward.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': The opponent's strategy suggests a cycle through rock, paper, and scissors, with a tendency to play paper more frequently after rock. In the last round, they played scissors after I played paper. Based on their pattern, they might cycle back to rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': If the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            ```python

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {157: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.5305716424617966, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. The hypothesis predicted the opponent would play rock after paper, which aligns with the recent play at round 252 where the opponent played rock after playing paper in round 251.

2. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - The opponent's plays in rounds 203 to 252 show a pattern where they often play rock after paper and scissors after rock.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays the same move consecutively, such as paper in rounds 250 and 251.
   - The opponent seems to favor playing rock after paper, as seen in rounds 252, 238, 224, and 210.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have received positive rewards when playing paper against rock, which supports the hypothesis that the opponent plays rock after paper.
   - Negative rewards were received when playing scissors against rock and paper against scissors, indicating the opponent's tendency to play rock after paper and scissors after rock.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern of paper, scissors, rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently.
   - The pattern suggests that after playing paper, the opponent is likely to play rock, and after playing rock, they are likely to play scissors.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the observed data. The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclical pattern with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play rock after paper and scissors after rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and given that they played rock in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {157: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.6714001497232576, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {157: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.6714001497232576, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. This hypothesis predicted that the opponent would play paper after rock.

2. **Recent Plays**:
   - Round 251: Opponent played scissors.
   - Round 252: Opponent played rock.
   - Round 253: Opponent played paper.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent's plays in the last three rounds (scissors, rock, paper) suggest a cyclic pattern.
   - The opponent played paper after rock in round 253, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I played rock, I received a negative reward in round 253 because the opponent played paper.
   - When I played paper, I received a positive reward in round 252 because the opponent played rock.
   - When I played scissors, I received a positive reward in rounds where the opponent played paper.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cyclic pattern of scissors, rock, paper, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently.
   - This pattern aligns with the previous hypothesis and recent plays.

6. **Strategy Implication**:
   - If the opponent continues this pattern, the next play after paper should be scissors.
   - To counter this, I should play rock in the next round.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the observed data, and the strategy to counter the opponent's pattern is to play rock next.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through scissors, rock, paper with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play scissors after paper.',
    'value': 0.6714001497232576,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through scissors, rock, and paper with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering their last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {158: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

            You last played: rock

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {158: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis (Round 158):** The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper. They tend to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

2. **Recent Interaction History:**
   - From rounds 205 to 254, the opponent's plays include a mix of rock, paper, and scissors.
   - Notably, there are several instances where the opponent played rock after paper and paper after rock, which aligns with the previous hypothesis of cycling.
   - In rounds 232 and 251, the opponent played rock and scissors, respectively, which resulted in losses for me when I played scissors and paper.
   - In rounds 253 and 254, the opponent played paper consecutively, resulting in losses for me when I played rock.

3. **Pattern Observation:**
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play paper more frequently, especially after playing rock or after a reset.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays paper after rock, which aligns with the cycling hypothesis.
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be somewhat predictable, with a bias towards playing paper.

4. **Reward Analysis:**
   - I have received positive rewards when playing paper against rock and scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards occurred when I played rock against paper, indicating the opponent's preference for paper in certain sequences.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement:**
   - The opponent's strategy likely involves cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently.
   - This bias towards paper can be exploited by playing scissors more often, especially after the opponent plays rock.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after rock. Exploit by playing scissors more often.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after rock, and considering that they played paper in the last two rounds, it is likely that they will continue this pattern and play scissors next.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {158: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper. The prediction was that they tend to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 206 to 255, there is a noticeable pattern where the opponent frequently plays rock after paper and paper after rock, with occasional plays of scissors.
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cycle, but there are deviations, such as playing scissors after paper in round 251.
   - The opponent's strategy might not be strictly cyclic but has a tendency to favor certain sequences.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent often plays rock after paper and paper after rock, aligning with the previous hypothesis of cycling.
   - There are occasional deviations, such as playing scissors after paper, which could indicate a slight randomness or a more complex cycle.
   - The opponent seems to play paper more frequently after a reset or after playing rock, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Playing rock has generally resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays scissors.
   - There are instances where playing rock resulted in negative rewards, indicating the opponent played paper.
   - Playing paper has also resulted in positive rewards, especially when the opponent plays rock.

5. **Refined Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent likely follows a semi-cyclic strategy with a preference for playing paper after rock and rock after paper.
   - There is a tendency to occasionally play scissors, possibly as a deviation from the cycle or as part of a longer cycle.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy seems to be a semi-cyclic pattern with occasional deviations. The strategy can be exploited by predicting their next move based on the observed cycle and deviations.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Semi-cyclic pattern with a preference for playing paper after rock and rock after paper, with occasional deviations to scissors.',
    'value': 0.55,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's semi-cyclic pattern with a preference for playing paper after rock and rock after paper, and considering that I last played rock and they played scissors, it is likely that they will follow their pattern and play paper next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my best move would be to play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {158: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Tends to play paper more frequently after rock or a reset.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

   - From rounds 207 to 231, I had a winning streak with a pattern of alternating plays (scissors, rock, paper) against the opponent's plays.
   - In round 232, I played scissors and lost to rock, suggesting a possible reset or change in the opponent's pattern.
   - In rounds 233 to 256, there were mixed results, with losses occurring when I played paper against scissors or rock against paper.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play rock after a series of losses or ties, which aligns with the previous hypothesis of cycling through moves.
   - The opponent's play pattern appears to be somewhat predictable, with rock appearing more frequently after a reset or a loss.

4. **Positive and Negative Rewards**:
   - Positive rewards were consistently obtained when I played rock against scissors and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occurred when I played scissors against rock or paper against scissors.

5. **Refined Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic pattern with a preference for rock after certain conditions (e.g., a reset or loss).
   - The opponent's strategy might involve cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to rock more frequently.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit the pattern by playing paper more frequently, especially after observing the opponent play rock or after a reset.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to rock more frequently after losses or ties. Rock appears more often after a reset or loss.',
    'value': 0.75,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to rock more frequently after losses or ties, and considering the last play was rock after a loss, it is likely that the opponent will play rock again in the next round.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {166: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after rock or a reset.

                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {166: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after rock or a reset. Non-adaptive cyclical pattern.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - From rounds 208 to 231, I had a strong winning streak, primarily using a sequence of rock, paper, and scissors.
   - The opponent's plays during this period were predictable, allowing me to consistently counter them.

2. **Recent Changes**:
   - Starting from round 232, there was a noticeable shift in the opponent's pattern. I began to experience losses and ties more frequently.
   - Specifically, losses occurred when I played scissors against rock (round 232), paper against scissors (round 251 and 257), and rock against paper (rounds 253 and 254).

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to have shifted from a predictable cycle to a more varied pattern, possibly introducing more frequent plays of scissors and paper.
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a cycle with a bias towards paper, but recent rounds indicate a potential increase in scissors plays.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent might still be cycling through rock, paper, and scissors but with a new bias towards scissors, especially after I play paper.
   - This could explain the recent losses when I played paper and scissors.

5. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - Given the recent losses when playing paper and scissors, it might be beneficial to increase the frequency of playing rock, as it counters both scissors and paper.
   - Monitoring the opponent's response to this adjustment will help refine the hypothesis further.

In summary, the opponent's strategy appears to have evolved from a simple cycle with a paper bias to a more complex pattern with increased scissors plays. My strategy should adapt by focusing more on playing rock to counter this shift.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a recent increase in scissors plays, especially after I play paper. Adjusted cyclical pattern with a scissors bias.',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a recent increase in scissors plays, especially after I play paper, it is likely that they will continue this pattern. Since I played paper in the last round and they responded with scissors, I predict they will play rock next to continue their cycle.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {166: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after rock or a reset. Non-adaptive cyclical pattern.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after rock or a reset. This was a non-adaptive cyclical pattern.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 209 to 258, the opponent's plays were:
     - Rock: 12 times
     - Paper: 10 times
     - Scissors: 8 times

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play rock more frequently than the other two options.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays the same move consecutively, such as rock or paper.
   - The opponent's strategy does not seem to adapt based on my plays, as there are no significant changes in their pattern after my wins or losses.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have consistently received positive rewards when playing paper, especially against rock.
   - Negative rewards occurred when I played scissors against rock or paper against scissors.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent appears to have a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently, possibly in a non-adaptive cyclical pattern.
   - The previous hypothesis about cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards paper might need adjustment to reflect a bias towards rock.

6. **Strategy Implication**:
   - Given the bias towards rock, I should consider playing paper more frequently to exploit this tendency.

Based on this analysis, the refined hypothesis is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently. Non-adaptive cyclical pattern.',
    'value': 0.55,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a bias towards playing rock more frequently, and considering their last play was rock, it is likely they will continue their cycle. However, given their bias towards rock, they might play rock again. Therefore, I predict their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by my opponent, I should play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {166: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after rock or a reset. Non-adaptive cyclical pattern.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing paper more frequently, especially after rock or a reset. This was a non-adaptive cyclical pattern.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 210 to 231, I had a winning streak by playing a mix of paper, rock, and scissors, suggesting the opponent was predictable.
   - At round 232, I lost with scissors against rock, indicating a possible shift or reset in their pattern.
   - From rounds 233 to 250, there were ties and losses, suggesting the opponent might have adjusted or the pattern was not as predictable.
   - At round 251, I lost with paper against scissors, and at round 252, I won with paper against rock, indicating a possible return to the previous pattern.
   - Recent rounds (253-259) show a mix of losses, wins, and ties, suggesting some variability in the opponent's strategy.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to favor paper, as seen in multiple rounds where I tied with paper.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays scissors after paper, indicating a possible cycle of paper -> scissors -> rock.
   - The opponent might reset or change the cycle after a loss or a series of ties.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were frequent when I played paper against rock and rock against scissors.
   - Negative rewards occurred when I played scissors against rock and paper against scissors.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern with a bias towards paper, but occasionally resets or changes the cycle, possibly after a loss or a series of ties.
   - The pattern might be paper -> scissors -> rock, with paper being more frequent.

Based on this analysis, my strategy should focus on countering the predicted cycle while being cautious of potential resets.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards paper. Occasional resets or changes in cycle, possibly after losses or ties.',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards paper, and considering the last play was paper resulting in a tie, it is likely that the opponent will continue their cycle. Therefore, their next play is predicted to be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {171: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. Frequently resets to paper after playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {171: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. Frequently resets to paper after playing rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock with a strong bias towards playing paper, frequently resetting to paper after playing rock. This hypothesis predicted the opponent's next play to be scissors, which suggests a cyclic pattern.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 212 to 231, I had a streak of wins by playing rock, paper, and scissors in a cyclic manner, which indicates the opponent was likely playing a predictable pattern.
   - At round 232, the opponent played rock against my scissors, resulting in a loss for me. This could indicate a shift or reset in their pattern.
   - From rounds 233 to 261, there are mixed results with some losses and ties, suggesting the opponent might have adjusted their pattern or introduced some randomness.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to have a cyclic pattern but occasionally introduces variations or resets. The losses at rounds 232, 251, 253, 254, 256, 257, and 261 suggest that the opponent might be introducing rock more frequently after a series of predictable plays.
   - The hypothesis of a cycle with a bias towards paper still holds some validity, but there might be a secondary pattern or a reset mechanism that introduces rock more frequently after certain plays.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were consistently obtained when I played rock against scissors and paper against rock, indicating the opponent's tendency to play scissors and rock in a predictable manner.
   - Negative rewards occurred when I played scissors against rock and paper against scissors, suggesting the opponent's occasional shift to rock and scissors.

**Refined Hypothesis**:
The opponent likely follows a cyclic pattern of paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards paper. However, they introduce rock more frequently after a series of predictable plays, possibly as a reset mechanism. This suggests a semi-predictable pattern with occasional deviations.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards paper. Occasionally introduces rock more frequently after a series of predictable plays, possibly as a reset mechanism.',
    'value': 0.4,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards paper, and the recent pattern of introducing rock more frequently, it seems likely that the opponent will continue with this pattern. Given that they just played rock, the next logical play in their cycle would be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted play of paper by the opponent, my best move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {171: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. Frequently resets to paper after playing rock.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {171: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. Frequently resets to paper after playing rock.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To determine the opponent's likely policy, let's analyze the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. They frequently reset to paper after playing rock. This hypothesis was made at round 171.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - From rounds 213 to 231, I consistently won by playing paper, scissors, and rock in a cycle, suggesting the opponent was likely playing rock, paper, and scissors in a predictable pattern.
   - At round 232, I lost when playing scissors against rock, indicating a potential reset or change in the opponent's pattern.
   - From rounds 233 to 262, there were a few losses and ties, but overall, I managed to win more often by playing a mix of rock, paper, and scissors.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to have a bias towards playing paper, as seen in the previous hypothesis and several rounds where I won by playing scissors.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays scissors and rock, but these seem less frequent.
   - The opponent's strategy might involve a cycle with a bias towards paper, occasionally switching to rock or scissors.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are frequent when I play scissors, suggesting the opponent often plays paper.
   - There are occasional losses with scissors against rock, indicating a possible reset or deviation in the opponent's pattern.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern with a bias towards playing paper. They occasionally switch to rock or scissors, possibly after a sequence of losses or ties.
   - The strategy of playing scissors frequently has been effective, but I should remain adaptable to counter any sudden changes in the opponent's pattern.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit the bias towards paper by playing scissors, while staying alert for any shifts in the opponent's strategy.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. Occasionally switches to rock or scissors after a sequence of losses or ties.',
    'value': 0.51,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a strong bias towards playing paper, and considering that they played paper in the last round, it is likely that they will continue the cycle and play scissors next. However, since they have a bias towards paper and just lost with paper, they might play paper again to try and win.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the possibility of the opponent playing paper again, I should play scissors, as it beats paper. If they switch to scissors, it will result in a tie, which is still preferable to a loss.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                The total interaction history is: [{'round': 214, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 215, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 216, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 217, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 218, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 219, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 220, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 221, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 222, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 223, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 224, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 225, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 226, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 227, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 228, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 229, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 230, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 231, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 232, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 233, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 234, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 235, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 236, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 237, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 238, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 239, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 240, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 241, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 242, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 243, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 244, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 245, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 246, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 247, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 248, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 249, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 250, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 251, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 252, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 253, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 254, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 255, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 256, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 257, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 258, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 259, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 260, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 261, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 262, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 263, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}].
                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {171: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. Frequently resets to paper after playing rock.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            You last played: scissors

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {171: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. Frequently resets to paper after playing rock.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was hypothesized to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a strong bias towards playing paper. This hypothesis was based on observations up to round 171.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - From rounds 214 to 231, I consistently won by playing a sequence of scissors, rock, and paper, suggesting the opponent was playing a predictable pattern.
   - From round 232 onwards, there were some losses and ties, indicating a possible change or variation in the opponent's strategy.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - **Rounds 214-231**: The opponent's plays were predictable, allowing me to win consistently.
   - **Rounds 232-263**: There were more ties and losses, suggesting the opponent might have adjusted their pattern or introduced more variability.

4. **Current Observations**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play paper frequently, as seen in the earlier rounds.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays scissors and rock, but paper appears to be a common choice.
   - The recent tie with scissors in round 263 suggests the opponent might be cycling through their choices again.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern with a bias towards paper, but occasionally introduces variability to disrupt my pattern recognition.
   - The opponent might reset their cycle after a certain number of rounds or after a specific play sequence.

6. **Strategy Implications**:
   - Given the bias towards paper, playing scissors more frequently could yield positive results.
   - However, I should remain adaptable and watch for any shifts in the opponent's pattern.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing paper. Occasionally introduces variability or resets the cycle.',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing paper, and considering the last play was scissors, it is likely that the opponent will continue the cycle. Given the pattern, the next play is predicted to be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of paper, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. Frequently resets to paper after playing rock.', 'value': 0.7599, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a strong bias towards playing paper and frequently resetting to paper after playing rock, I predict that their next play will be paper. This prediction is supported by the fact that their last play was rock, and they tend to reset to paper after playing rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that I predict the opponent will play paper next, my best counter-move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. Frequently resets to paper after playing rock.', 'value': 0.8319300000000001, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the observed pattern, the opponent tends to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a strong bias towards playing paper. After playing paper, they often follow with scissors. Given that the last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. Frequently resets to paper after playing rock.', 'value': 0.94235199, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a strong bias towards playing paper, and frequently resetting to paper after playing rock, I predict that their next play will be paper. This prediction is supported by the pattern observed in the interaction history, where the opponent tends to play paper after a sequence involving rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be to play scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {171: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. Frequently resets to paper after playing rock.', 'value': 0.359646393, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {171: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. Frequently resets to paper after playing rock.', 'value': 0.359646393, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a strong bias towards playing paper. This hypothesis predicted the opponent's next play as paper, and suggested playing scissors as a counter.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - From rounds 220 to 231, I consistently won by playing a sequence of scissors, rock, and paper against their paper, scissors, and rock.
   - From rounds 232 to 269, there were more varied outcomes, including ties and losses, indicating potential changes or randomness in the opponent's strategy.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to have a pattern of playing paper frequently, which aligns with the previous hypothesis of a bias towards paper.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays scissors and rock, but these seem less frequent or potentially part of a cycle.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were consistently achieved when playing scissors against paper, rock against scissors, and paper against rock.
   - Negative rewards occurred when playing the same move repeatedly, suggesting the opponent might adjust or have a cycle that occasionally counters my repeated plays.

5. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cycle of paper, scissors, and rock, but with a higher frequency of playing paper.
   - The hypothesis that they reset to paper after playing rock seems plausible, given the observed outcomes.

6. **Strategy Moving Forward**:
   - Continue to exploit the bias towards paper by playing scissors more frequently.
   - Be cautious of potential cycles and adjust if a pattern of losses emerges.

Based on this analysis, the refined hypothesis is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a strong bias towards playing paper. Frequently resets to paper after playing rock.',
    'value': 0.359646393,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a strong bias towards playing paper, and frequently resetting to paper after playing rock, I predict their next play will be paper. This is because the last play was scissors, and according to their cycle, paper should follow.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my next play should be scissors to counter their paper and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {173: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after I play scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {173: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Initial Winning Streak (Rounds 221-231):** During these rounds, I consistently won by cycling through rock, paper, and scissors. This suggests that the opponent might have been playing a predictable pattern that I was able to counter effectively.

2. **First Loss (Round 232):** I played scissors and lost to rock. This could indicate a shift in the opponent's pattern or a reset to rock, as previously hypothesized.

3. **Mixed Results (Rounds 233-270):** The results become more varied, with a mix of wins, losses, and ties. Notably, losses occur when I play scissors against rock (Rounds 232, 256, 261, 264, 270) and paper against scissors (Rounds 251, 257).

4. **Previous Hypothesis:** The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.

5. **Current Observations:**
   - The opponent seems to favor rock after I play scissors, as seen in multiple rounds where I lost with scissors against rock.
   - There are occasional ties when I play paper against paper, suggesting the opponent might also play paper frequently.
   - The hypothesis of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards rock still holds, especially given the losses when I play scissors.

6. **Refinement of Hypothesis:** The opponent's strategy appears to involve cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a noticeable bias towards playing rock after I play scissors. This pattern is consistent with the previous hypothesis and explains the observed outcomes.

In conclusion, the opponent's strategy seems to involve a cycle with a bias towards rock, especially after I play scissors. This aligns with the previous hypothesis and explains the interaction history.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after I play scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after I play scissors, and considering the recent pattern, it is likely that their next play will be paper, as they tend to follow the cycle after playing rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter-move would be to play scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {173: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. There are occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 222 to 271, there are several instances where the opponent played rock after paper and scissors, aligning with the previous hypothesis.
   - The opponent seems to play paper, scissors, and rock in a somewhat cyclical manner but with a tendency to play rock more often after paper or scissors.
   - There are occasional ties and losses, indicating some variability, but the pattern of cycling with a bias towards rock is evident.

3. **Positive and Negative Rewards**:
   - Positive rewards are consistently achieved when playing scissors against paper and rock against scissors.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing scissors against rock and paper against scissors, which suggests that the opponent's strategy is not entirely static but follows a predictable pattern.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cycle of paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. This pattern is consistent with the previous hypothesis.
   - The opponent occasionally resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors, which aligns with the observed data.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy is likely a cyclical pattern with a bias towards rock, especially after playing paper or scissors. This strategy can be exploited by anticipating the cycle and playing the counter move.

Based on this analysis, the refined hypothesis is:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors, and considering the last play was scissors, it is likely that the opponent will play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {174: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {174: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. There are occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 223 to 231, I had a winning streak with a pattern of alternating plays (scissors, rock, paper).
   - From round 232, I started losing or tying more frequently, indicating a potential shift or adaptation in the opponent's strategy.
   - The opponent has played scissors more frequently in recent rounds, leading to losses when I played paper (rounds 251, 257, 272).

3. **Pattern Recognition**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play scissors after I play paper, as seen in rounds 251, 257, and 272.
   - There is a noticeable pattern where the opponent plays rock after I play scissors, as seen in rounds 232, 256, 261, 264, and 270.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play rock against scissors (rounds 224, 230, 234, 237, 240, 243, 246, 249, 255, 260, 266).
   - Negative rewards occur when I play paper against scissors (rounds 251, 257, 272).

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve a cycle with a bias towards playing scissors after I play paper and rock after I play scissors.
   - The opponent might be using a pattern recognition strategy to counter my plays, especially focusing on countering paper with scissors and scissors with rock.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing scissors after paper and rock after scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

This hypothesis suggests that playing rock is a favorable strategy to counter the opponent's tendency to play scissors after I play paper.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing scissors after paper, it is likely that their next play will be rock. This is because they played scissors in the last round, and the pattern suggests a tendency to play rock after scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {174: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors.

                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.

                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {174: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. There are occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - The opponent's plays from round 224 to 273 show a pattern where they often play rock after paper or scissors.
   - There are instances where the opponent played rock after playing paper or scissors, supporting the previous hypothesis of a bias towards rock.
   - The opponent's plays seem to follow a cyclic pattern but with a tendency to play rock more frequently.

3. **Analysis of Rewards**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play rock against scissors, paper against rock, and scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play scissors against rock, paper against scissors, and rock against paper.
   - The pattern of rewards suggests the opponent's plays are predictable, aligning with the hypothesis of a cyclic strategy with a bias towards rock.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclic pattern with a bias towards playing rock more frequently, especially after playing paper or scissors.
   - This strategy is not entirely static but shows a predictable pattern that can be exploited.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclic strategy with a bias towards rock, especially after playing paper or scissors. This pattern can be exploited by anticipating their next move based on the cycle and bias.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the previous one, and I will continue to exploit this pattern by playing the counter strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a slight bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors, and considering the last play was rock, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {179: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - The opponent played rock after paper and scissors in several instances.
   - There are instances where the opponent played paper after rock (e.g., round 274).
   - The opponent has shown a pattern of playing paper, scissors, and rock, but with a tendency to play rock more frequently after certain plays.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - From rounds 225 to 274, the opponent's plays seem to follow a cycle with a bias towards rock after certain plays.
   - The opponent tends to play rock after paper and scissors, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.
   - The opponent occasionally plays paper after rock, as seen in round 274.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing paper against rock and scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards occur when playing rock against paper and scissors against rock.
   - The pattern suggests that the opponent's strategy might be predictable, allowing for exploitation by playing the counter strategy.

5. **Refined Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasionally, the opponent plays paper after rock, but the overall pattern remains consistent.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclic pattern with a bias towards rock, especially after playing paper or scissors. This pattern can be exploited by anticipating the opponent's next move and playing the counter strategy.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasionally plays paper after rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors, and occasionally playing paper after rock, their last play was paper. Therefore, it is likely that their next play will be scissors, following their cycle pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my next play should be rock to counter their scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {179: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. There are occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - From rounds 226 to 275, the opponent's plays are as follows:
     - Paper: 11 times
     - Scissors: 15 times
     - Rock: 9 times

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play scissors more frequently than rock or paper.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays rock after playing paper or scissors, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.
   - The opponent occasionally plays the same move consecutively, but not consistently enough to form a predictable pattern.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I play rock, I often receive positive rewards, indicating that the opponent frequently plays scissors.
   - Playing paper also yields positive rewards, suggesting the opponent plays rock occasionally.
   - Playing scissors has mixed results, with both positive and negative rewards, indicating the opponent plays paper and rock.

5. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent likely follows a pattern where they cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a slight bias towards playing scissors more frequently.
   - There is a tendency to play rock after playing paper or scissors, but this is not a strict rule.
   - The opponent's strategy might not be entirely static, but it does not appear to adapt significantly to my plays.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains similar to the previous one, with a slight emphasis on the opponent's tendency to play scissors more frequently.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing scissors more frequently. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing scissors more frequently, and considering their last play was scissors (which I countered with rock), it is likely they will follow their cycle and play paper next.
2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent will play paper next, my best counter move would be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {179: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {179: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. There are occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - **Wins**: When I played rock against scissors, paper against rock, and scissors against paper.
   - **Losses**: When I played scissors against rock, paper against scissors, and rock against paper.
   - **Ties**: Occurred when both played the same move.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to play rock frequently after playing paper or scissors, as noted in the previous hypothesis.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays the same move consecutively (e.g., paper against paper, scissors against scissors).
   - The opponent's play does not appear to be purely random, as there are observable patterns and biases.

4. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy seems to involve a cyclic pattern with a bias towards rock, especially after playing paper or scissors.
   - The opponent occasionally repeats the same move, leading to ties.
   - The hypothesis that the opponent resets to rock after playing paper and scissors is supported by the recent history.

5. **Exploitation Strategy**:
   - Given the bias towards rock, playing paper more frequently could yield positive results.
   - Since the opponent occasionally repeats moves, predicting and countering repeated plays could be beneficial.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors. Occasional resets to rock, especially after playing paper and scissors. Repeats moves occasionally leading to ties.',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a bias towards playing rock more frequently after paper or scissors, and considering the last play was rock, it is likely that the opponent will continue this cycle. Given that they played rock last, their next play might be paper, following their cycle pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my best move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {181: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Likely to play scissors after paper and rock after scissors.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was hypothesized to cycle through "paper, scissors, rock" with occasional resets to paper. This means after playing paper, they would likely play scissors, and after scissors, they would play rock.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - **Round 277**: I played scissors and the opponent played paper. I won.
   - **Round 276**: I played scissors and the opponent played rock. I lost.
   - **Round 275**: I played rock and the opponent played scissors. I won.
   - **Round 274**: I played rock and the opponent played paper. I lost.
   - **Round 273**: I played paper and the opponent played rock. I won.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a pattern where they play "rock" after "scissors" and "paper" after "rock". This aligns with the previous hypothesis of cycling through "paper, scissors, rock".
   - There are occasional deviations, but the cycle seems to reset back to paper after a few rounds.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I received positive rewards when I played the counter to the predicted opponent's play based on the cycle hypothesis.
   - Negative rewards occurred when I deviated from the expected counter strategy or when the opponent's cycle reset unexpectedly.

5. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy is likely a cycle of "paper, scissors, rock" with occasional resets to paper. This cycle can be exploited by predicting their next move based on the current play and countering it.

Based on this analysis, I will continue to exploit this cycle by playing the counter to the predicted next move of the opponent.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Likely to play scissors after paper and rock after scissors.',
    'value': 0.3,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper, and given that their last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors, following their pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's next play of scissors, my best move would be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {181: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Likely to play scissors after paper and rock after scissors.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To determine my opponent's strategy, let's analyze the interaction history and my previous hypothesis:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: My previous hypothesis suggested that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper. It predicted that the opponent would play scissors after paper and rock after scissors.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - From round 229 to 278, I observed a pattern where I won consistently when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock. 
   - There were occasional losses when I played rock against paper or scissors against rock, indicating some variability in the opponent's play.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to frequently play scissors after paper and rock after scissors, which aligns with my previous hypothesis.
   - There are occasional deviations where the opponent plays paper after rock, which could be a reset or a random element in their strategy.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - I have been getting positive rewards when playing rock against scissors and paper against rock, which suggests that the opponent's strategy is somewhat predictable and exploitable.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play rock against paper or scissors against rock, indicating these are the opponent's counter moves.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclical pattern with occasional resets, as previously hypothesized. The pattern seems to be: paper -> scissors -> rock, with occasional resets to paper.
   - This strategy can be exploited by anticipating the next move based on the observed cycle and playing the counter move.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis remains consistent with the previous one, with a slight refinement to account for occasional resets.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Likely to play scissors after paper and rock after scissors.',
    'value': 0.51,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper, and given that they played scissors in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of rock, my next play should be paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {181: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Likely to play scissors after paper and rock after scissors.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {181: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Likely to play scissors after paper and rock after scissors.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was hypothesized to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper. The prediction was that they would play scissors after paper and rock after scissors.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - **Rounds 230-239**: The opponent played a predictable pattern: scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock.
   - **Rounds 240-249**: The pattern continued: scissors, rock, paper, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock.
   - **Rounds 250-259**: The pattern slightly deviated but mostly followed the same cycle: paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, rock, scissors, paper, rock.
   - **Rounds 260-269**: The pattern continued with minor deviations: scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors.
   - **Rounds 270-279**: The pattern continued: rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cycle of paper, scissors, rock with occasional deviations.
   - The deviations are not frequent enough to disrupt the overall pattern.
   - The opponent's play after paper is often scissors, and after scissors, it is often rock.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when playing the counter to the expected pattern: paper against rock, rock against scissors, and scissors against paper.
   - The strategy of predicting the opponent's next move based on the cycle has been effective.

5. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent is likely following a cyclic pattern of paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper.
   - The pattern is predictable enough to exploit by playing the counter move.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the previous one, with a slight refinement to account for occasional deviations.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Likely to play scissors after paper and rock after scissors.',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper, and given that they played rock in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted opponent's play of scissors, my next play should be rock, as rock beats scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with occasional resets to paper, and considering their last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of scissors, my next play should be rock.

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper, and considering the last play was rock, the opponent is likely to play paper next. This is because they tend to follow rock with paper in their cycle.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {182: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

            You last played: scissors
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper after rock. Predictable pattern can be exploited by countering the expected next move.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

            ```python

              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {182: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. After playing rock, they are likely to play paper.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - **Rounds 233-250**: The opponent played a mix of paper, scissors, and rock. There were several ties with paper, and losses when I played paper against scissors.
   - **Rounds 251-282**: The opponent's plays seem to follow a pattern where they often play rock after scissors, and paper after rock. This aligns with the previous hypothesis of cycling through the moves.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cycle: paper -> scissors -> rock, with occasional deviations.
   - After playing rock, they often switch to paper, which matches the hypothesis.
   - There are instances where they play scissors after paper, which fits the cycle pattern.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are obtained when I play rock against scissors and scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards occur when I play paper against scissors or rock against paper.

5. **Strategy Refinement**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a predictable cycle with a tendency to reset to paper after rock.
   - This cycle can be exploited by anticipating their next move based on the pattern.

**Conclusion**: The opponent is likely following a cyclic strategy of paper -> scissors -> rock, with a tendency to reset to paper after rock. This pattern can be exploited by playing the counter move to their predicted next play.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper after rock. Predictable pattern can be exploited by countering the expected next move.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, and considering their last play was rock, their next likely play is paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's expected play of paper, my next play should be scissors.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper',
  'my_next_play': 'scissors'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {182: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {182: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's review the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Interaction History Analysis**:
   - From rounds 234 to 283, there is a noticeable pattern where I won consistently when playing a sequence of rock, paper, scissors against the opponent's sequence of scissors, rock, paper.
   - There are some deviations where the opponent played paper twice in a row (rounds 250, 259) and scissors twice in a row (rounds 251, 257), but these are exceptions rather than the rule.
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play paper after rock, which aligns with the previous hypothesis.

2. **Previous Hypothesis**:
   - The hypothesis from round 182 suggested that the opponent cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. This hypothesis predicted the opponent's next play as paper, which matches the observed pattern.

3. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards are consistently obtained when playing scissors after the opponent plays paper, and rock after the opponent plays scissors.
   - Negative rewards occur when I deviate from the sequence or when the opponent deviates from their expected pattern.

4. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclic pattern of paper, scissors, rock, with occasional resets to paper. This explains the observed data well, as the majority of rounds fit this pattern.
   - The hypothesis remains consistent with the observed data, indicating that the opponent is likely following a static cyclic strategy with a bias towards paper.

Based on this analysis, the hypothesis about the opponent's strategy is as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with occasional resets to paper. Likely to play paper after rock.',
    'value': 0.75,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with occasional resets to paper, and considering the last play was paper, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors next, my best counter move would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.

            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',

Response: 

Top hypotheses: {182: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. This hypothesis predicted that after playing rock, the opponent would likely play paper.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - From rounds 235 to 284, the opponent's plays were: rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors, rock, paper, scissors.
   - This sequence suggests a pattern of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors, with occasional deviations.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cyclical pattern of rock, paper, scissors, with some deviations where they repeat a play (e.g., paper twice in a row).
   - The hypothesis that the opponent resets to paper more frequently is supported by the data, as paper appears more often in the sequence.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - Positive rewards were obtained when playing rock against scissors, paper against rock, and scissors against paper.
   - Negative rewards occurred when playing rock against paper, paper against scissors, and scissors against rock.
   - The pattern of rewards aligns with the expected outcomes of the cyclical strategy.

5. **Refinement of Hypothesis**:
   - The opponent likely follows a cyclical strategy of rock, paper, scissors, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently.
   - This strategy can be exploited by predicting the next play based on the cycle and the tendency to reset to paper.

Based on this analysis, the opponent's strategy can be summarized as follows:

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through rock, paper, scissors with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.',
    'value': 0.657,
    'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors', 'my_next_play': 'rock'}
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through rock, paper, and scissors with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering that they played scissors in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be rock.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```

            You last played: paper
            You previously guessed that their policy or strategy is: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy countering my last move. Likely to play scissors after paper, paper after rock, and rock after scissors.'}.
            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {204: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.3, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and look for patterns:

1. **Winning Streaks and Losses**: 
   - From rounds 236 to 249, I had a winning streak using a cycle of scissors, rock, and paper. This suggests the opponent was likely cycling through a predictable pattern that I was able to counter effectively.
   - Starting from round 250, the pattern of wins and losses became less consistent. Notably, losses occurred when I played paper against scissors (rounds 251, 257, 272, 285) and rock against paper (rounds 253, 254, 274, 280).

2. **Opponent's Likely Pattern**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play scissors after I play paper, as seen in rounds 251, 257, 272, and 285.
   - The opponent also tends to play paper after I play rock, as seen in rounds 253, 254, 274, and 280.
   - There are instances where the opponent plays rock after I play scissors, as seen in rounds 256, 261, 264, 270, 276, 282.

3. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to cycle through a pattern but adjusts based on my previous play. They might be using a strategy that counters my last move.
   - The previous hypothesis suggested a cycle with a tendency to reset to paper. However, the recent rounds indicate a more reactive strategy where the opponent counters my last move.

4. **Strategy to Counter**:
   - Given the opponent's tendency to counter my last move, I should consider playing the move that beats the counter to my last play. For example, if I played paper last and lost to scissors, I should play rock next to counter their expected scissors.

In summary, the opponent appears to be using a reactive strategy that counters my last move. This suggests they are not cycling through a static pattern but rather adapting to my plays.

```python
{
'Opponent_strategy': 'Reactive strategy countering my last move. Likely to play scissors after paper, paper after rock, and rock after scissors.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's reactive strategy, they tend to play scissors after I play paper. Since my last play was paper, I predict their next play will be scissors.
2. 'my_next_play': To counter their likely play of scissors, my best move would be rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {204: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.51, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Response:

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's break down the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis (Round 204):** The opponent was thought to cycle through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. The prediction was that they would play rock after paper.

2. **Recent Interaction History:**
   - From rounds 237 to 249, I won consistently by playing rock, paper, and scissors in a sequence, indicating the opponent might have been cycling through a predictable pattern.
   - From rounds 250 to 286, there were mixed results with some losses and ties, suggesting the opponent might have adjusted or the pattern became less predictable.

3. **Pattern Analysis:**
   - Wins were frequent when I played rock against scissors and paper against rock, indicating the opponent might be playing scissors and rock more often.
   - Losses occurred when I played paper against scissors and rock against paper, suggesting the opponent also plays scissors and paper.

4. **Current Hypothesis:**
   - The opponent seems to have a pattern but with some variability. They might be cycling through rock, paper, and scissors but not in a strict order. There is a tendency to play scissors and rock more frequently, which aligns with the previous hypothesis of cycling with a bias.

5. **Strategy Adjustment:**
   - Given the mixed results, the opponent might be using a semi-random strategy with a slight bias towards scissors and rock. To exploit this, I should focus on playing paper more frequently, as it counters both rock and scissors effectively.

In summary, the opponent's strategy appears to be a semi-random cycle with a bias towards playing scissors and rock. This can be exploited by playing paper more often.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Semi-random cycle with a bias towards scissors and rock. Play paper more frequently to exploit.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's semi-random cycle with a bias towards scissors and rock, and the fact that the last round was a tie with both playing rock, it is likely that the opponent will switch to scissors, as they have shown a tendency to cycle through options after ties or losses.

2. 'my_next_play': Given the prediction that the opponent will play scissors, my next play should be rock to counter their scissors and secure a win.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {204: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.

            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {204: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.657, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'paper', 'my_next_play': 'scissors'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the recent interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. This hypothesis predicted that after playing rock, the opponent would likely play paper.

2. **Recent Interaction History**:
   - Round 286: Opponent played rock.
   - Round 287: Opponent played paper.

   This sequence aligns with the previous hypothesis, where the opponent tends to play paper after rock.

3. **Pattern Observation**:
   - The opponent seems to follow a cycle of paper, scissors, rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently.
   - Recent plays (rounds 286 and 287) support this pattern, as the opponent played rock followed by paper.

4. **Reward Analysis**:
   - When I played rock, I received a negative reward when the opponent played paper (rounds 287, 280, 274, 253, 254).
   - When I played paper, I received positive rewards when the opponent played rock (rounds 238, 241, 244, 247, 252, 258, 267, 273, 279).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The opponent's strategy appears to be a cyclic pattern with a bias towards playing paper after rock.
   - This pattern can be exploited by anticipating the opponent's next play based on the cycle and countering it.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis remains consistent with the observed data. The opponent likely follows a cyclic pattern with a tendency to reset to paper after rock.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and given that they played paper in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be scissors.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play scissors, my best counter would be to play rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'scissors',
  'my_next_play': 'rock'
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering their last play was scissors (since I played rock and won), it is likely that their next play will be rock, following their cycle pattern.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play rock next, my best counter move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'

            High-level strategy Request:
            Provide the next high-level strategy for player player_0.
            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.94235199, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and considering that they played rock in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': Given that the opponent is likely to play paper next, my best counter move would be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

            Think step by step in parts 1 and 2 about which strategy to select based on the entire interaction history in the following format:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given the above mentioned guess about the opponent's policy/strategy, and the last action you played (if their strategy is adaptive, it may not be), what is their likely play in the next round.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given the opponent's likely play in the next round, what should your next play be to counter this?
            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.

Good hypothesis found: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.9802267325699999, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently, and given that they played rock in the last round, it is likely that their next play will be paper.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the opponent's likely play of paper, my next play should be scissors, as scissors beats paper.

                The total interaction history is: [{'round': 249, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 250, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 251, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 252, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 253, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 254, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 255, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 256, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 257, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 258, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 259, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 260, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 261, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 262, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 263, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 264, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 265, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 266, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 267, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 268, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 269, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 270, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 271, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 272, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 273, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 274, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 275, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 276, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 277, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 278, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 279, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 280, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 281, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 282, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 283, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 284, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 285, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 286, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 0}, {'round': 287, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': -1}, {'round': 288, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 289, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 290, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 291, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 292, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 293, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 294, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 295, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'rock', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 296, 'my_play': 'scissors', 'opponent_play': 'paper', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 297, 'my_play': 'rock', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': 3}, {'round': 298, 'my_play': 'paper', 'opponent_play': 'scissors', 'my_reward': -1}].
                Here are your previous hypotheses about the algorithm your opponent is playing: {204: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.39321776927151, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}.
                What is your opponent's likely policy given their plays? Think step by step about this given the interaction history.
                If your previous hypotheses are useful, you can iterate and refine them to get a better explanation of the data observed so far.
                If a hypothesis already explains the data very well, then repeat the hypothesis in this response.
                They may be playing the same static policy every time, a complex strategy to counter you, or anything in between.
                They are not necessarily a smart agent that adapts to your strategy, you are just playing an algorithm.
                Are you getting positive or negative reward when playing the same choice?
                For example getting positive reward every time you play rock.
                If so, your opponent may be playing a static strategy and you can exploit this by playing the counter strategy.
                Once you have output a hypothesis about your opponent's strategy with step by step reasoning, you can use hypothesis to inform your strategy.
                In the 2nd part of your response, summarize your hypothesis in a concise message following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
                This summary will be shown to you in the future in order for you to select the appropriate counter strategy.
                Example summary:
                ```python
                {
                'Opponent_strategy': ''
                }
                ```

                You will be prompted again shortly to select your next play, so do not include that in your response yet right now.

            3. In the 3rd part of your response, output the predicted opponent's next play and your next play as either 'rock', 'paper', or 'scissors' (use no other string) in following Python dictionary format, parsable by `ast.literal_eval()` starting with ```python.
            Example response:
            1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe their next play will be a rock.
            2. 'my_next_play': Given that my opponent is playing a rock policy, I believe my next play should be paper.
            ```python
            {
              'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
              'my_next_play': 'paper'
            }
            


Response: 

Top hypotheses: {204: {'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through paper, scissors, rock with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. Likely to play paper after rock.', 'value': 0.39321776927151, 'next_plays': {'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock', 'my_next_play': 'paper'}}}

To analyze the opponent's strategy, let's examine the interaction history and previous hypotheses:

1. **Previous Hypothesis**: The opponent cycles through paper, scissors, and rock, with a tendency to reset to paper more frequently. It was predicted that after playing rock, the opponent is likely to play paper.

2. **Recent Interaction History**: 
   - The opponent played scissors in the last round (298) when I played paper.
   - Before that, the opponent played a sequence of rock, paper, and scissors in various rounds.

3. **Pattern Analysis**:
   - The opponent has shown a pattern of playing scissors after paper (rounds 251, 257, 272, 285, 298).
   - When I played rock, the opponent often played scissors (rounds 249, 255, 260, 266, 278, 284, 291, 294, 297), which resulted in positive rewards for me.
   - When I played paper, the opponent sometimes played rock (rounds 252, 258, 267, 273, 279, 289, 292, 295), which also resulted in positive rewards for me.

4. **Hypothesis Refinement**:
   - The opponent seems to have a tendency to play scissors after I play paper.
   - The opponent often plays rock after I play paper, which I can exploit by playing paper more frequently.
   - The opponent's strategy might involve a pattern of playing scissors after paper and rock after paper, which I can counter by playing paper more often.

5. **Strategy Adjustment**:
   - Given the opponent's tendency to play rock after I play paper, I should continue playing paper to exploit this pattern.
   - If the opponent plays scissors after paper, I should be cautious and consider playing rock occasionally to counter this.

Based on this analysis, my hypothesis is that the opponent cycles through a pattern where they tend to play scissors after paper and rock after paper, which can be exploited by playing paper more frequently.

```python
{
    'Opponent_strategy': 'Cycles through a pattern where they tend to play scissors after paper and rock after paper. Exploit by playing paper more frequently.',
    'value': 0.45,
    'next_plays': {
        'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
        'my_next_play': 'paper'
    }
}
```

1. 'predicted_opponent_next_play': Based on the opponent's strategy of cycling through a pattern where they tend to play scissors after paper and rock after paper, and given that their last play was scissors, it is likely they will follow their pattern and play rock next.

2. 'my_next_play': To counter the predicted rock play by the opponent, my best move would be to play paper, as paper beats rock.

```python
{
  'predicted_opponent_next_play': 'rock',
  'my_next_play': 'paper'
}
```
